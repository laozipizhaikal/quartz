> [!example]- Abstract
> *The debt position of the state governments in India, which deteriorated sharply between 1997â€“1998 and 2003â€“2004, has witnessed significant improvement since 2004â€“2005. Debt sustainability analysis based on empirical estimation of inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function in a panel data framework, covering 20 Indian states for the period 1980â€“1981 to 2015â€“2016, indicates that the debt position at the state level is sustainable in the long run. The increase in contingent liabilities of states and take-over of large chunk of these liabilities through debt restructuring of State Power Distribution Companies, however, would adversely affect the debt position of states.*
