> [!example]- Abstract
> *Debt sustainability is an essential attribute of good macroeconomic policies but its precise definition is elusive and its assessment is even more challenging. The IMF has developed a sophisticated approach but it must be recognized that, because the future is unknown, any debt sustainability assessment is only valid within the bounds of the underlying guesses. There is no support for the view that added complexity allows for more precise assessments. As a consequence, policy conclusions drawn from debts sustainability exercises must be considered with care. Sacrificing growth â€“ in the short and even in the long run â€“ to imprecisely known risks can be very costly.*

### âœ… Definition

> The horizon should be long, say ten years. As argued in Section 3.3, debt corrections are best carried out slowly, with small changes in the primary account maintained over a long period. Debt corrections are inherently costly, the costlier the sharper they are. The same effect, if sustained, can be achieved at a much lower cost if it is spread on many years.

> A number of countries have taken steps to improve their policy-making institutions in the area of fiscal policy, with much success so far. Brazil and Chile, for instance, have adopted formal procedures that bind policy actions within a framework that put debt sustainability at the forefront. Most East Asian countries have informally done so, relying on norms instead of legal arrangements. Mechanical DSA, as discussed in the present paper, implicitly take institutions as given, while CPIA does so explicitly.
