# Macroeconomic Policies 
## Classical
Create surpluses in current account for expenses 
no borrowing 
borrowing for creation of asset is acceptable.. if it is put for productive use so that they do not build up
against govt borrowing

Believed in full employment 
[[Say's Law of Markets]]
	The classical economists always assumed a state of employment in the economy. The normal situation in an economy, according to them was full employment equilibrium. Less than full employment, they believed, was an abnormal situation. 
	..
	There is surplus labour - wages will decrease - more hiring - full employment
	..
	savings and investment imbalance - more savings than investment - interest rates will declines - as it declines - marginal efficiency of capital vs rate of interest - low rates make it profitable to invest 

### On Deficit
reduction in government spending will not be offset by private saving so interest rate in increased and adversely affects growth
fiscal deficits raise lifetime consumption by shifting taxes to the future generation

## Keynesian
market adjustment as per Say’s law does not happen..
wages and interest rate does not go down below certain rates 
downward rigidity for both interest rate and wages.  

Hence the general equilibrium is unemployment - government has to come in and create demand..

only when aggregate demand increases - more investment - more consumption - more demand for good - more employment - more income generated 

Productivity is not important for government spending
deficit and debt - functional finance - how will u finance it? create money supply

### On Deficit
inc in govt expenditure enhances aggregate demand and will increase output ad employment through the multiplier. 
When expansion is financed through bonds, increase in interest rate may partially offset the multiplier, but increase in aggregate demand increase private investment profitability. 

Lerner
no impact only bond holders paying tax

## Neo-classical 
#MiltonFriedman 
### Criticism of Keynesian 
but increase in money supply will NOT result in increase in income and employment it only results in increase in prices because there are rigidities.  

So as the economy approaches the full amount of employment level any additional spending or money supply..  
M * V = P * T → [[Fisher Equation]] 
When volume of transaction does not increase and money supply increases price will increase

So do this in depression and recession 

trade off between and employment and price rise
invariably money supply will cause inflation

When there is recession government has to act and increase **aggregate demand** and when economy improves government must withdraw. 

### Buchanan on deficit 
Opportunity cost of saving - money removed from the system when government borrows - and if the money is not invested productively.. high impact.  
- primary burden shifted to future generation
- anology btw private and public debt is correct
- external and internal debt are fundamentally equivalent 
### RIchardian equivalence theorem 
fiscal deficits are neutral on their effect on growth. Merely postponement of taxes. useful for smoothening the impact of revenue shocks. 
No impact on aggregate demand as households offset the future tax payments by saving currently. 

-ve:
individuals can not guess government interest rates / discount rate,

Policymakers have myopic view - do not worry about borrowing. 

untill 1991, fiscal deficit was not used in India. 
Government uses illusion to overcome - off balance sheet borrowing, creative accounting 

fiscal responsibility framework 
Independent Fiscal Institutions

## Conceptual 
Revenue Deficit = Revenue Receipts - Revenue Expenditure

Fiscal Deficit (Revenue Receipts + non debt capital receipts) - Total Expenditure (Revenue and Capital)

Primary Deficit (Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments)

[[Domar Debt Sustainability]] 

Domar (1944) argued that the ratio of public debt to GDP would be stable in the long run provided that the growth rate of GDP exceeds the effective interest rate on public debt. Primary deficit must be zero

## Macro Economic Linkages 
### imbalances
Relationship btw fiscal imbalance, savings investment imbalance and balance of payment disequilibrium 

Y = C + I + G + X - M
	Y = C + S + T
(M - X) = (I - S) + (G - T)

Y = income 
C = consumption 
I = investment
G = government expenditure
X = export
M = import 
S = savings
T = tax revenue (here includes non tax revenue also)
(M-X) = Balance of Payments 
(I - S) = Savings investment imbalance
(G - T) - Fiscal Deficit

### others
High interest payments
crowding out
inter generational equity
credit rating - cost of borrowing by corporate sector abroad increases

## History
legislation happened in 2003 / 2004 - based on 5th finance commission recommendation
2003 - 2008 revenue increased so deficit decreased - due to TIN - increase in direct tax revenue and service tax base was widened. 
in 2008 before 2009 - MNERGA, Pay Commision and farm loan , oil price - fiscal discipline broke down -
