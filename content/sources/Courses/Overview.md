Why not private finance? Why public finance? 
to ask a question on public finance is to ask a question on government 

Role of state - what should they so
- some think govt is a social guardian.. maximise welfare
- few want the government to keep low not interfere

Also when we want govt to do something . can it do something?

a view - [[Public Choice Theory]] 
Government is a necessary evil.. market does not do everything so govt is needed but confine government to only things that market can not do 

public finance comes in when the government starts spending.. they are spending on public services and those can not be charged.. hence enforcement of taxes… when tax is inadequate and then government borrows… 

so public spending - expense is starting point 

when government borrow - it has opportunity cost, money has to be repaid - intergenerational equity question  

then spending - since certain decisions can not be made from central place - need federalism

# State vs Market
Why government exist? what should they do?

Anarchy, Dictatorship & Democracy 
	provide basic public good required to enable the market to fuction
	- ensuring safety and security of the people
	- enforcing contracts
	- maintaining law & order
	these can not be provided by the market
## Public Goods
	non rival in consumption - indivisible & 
	non excludable - free riding 
	people do not reveal their preference  - prices can not be charged no demand curve - no prices can be charged.. enforce charges - taxes - compulsory payment in the form of taxes - tax regime
	public goods entail free riding 

## Externality 
Underprovisioned by the market - only the private benefit is equated to private cost and social benefi is ignored 

Why government provide education? 
Market failure in redistribution - so government can do redistribution. no more intervention. 

Concept of merit goods - there is no limit 

solution to oligopoly is not government take over but regulation

ownership - public finance is needed - provision of public service
vs 
regulation - public finance is not involved 

public service depends on the idea of role of state 

not all areas of market failure require public finance 

logic of collective action - government can spend only if there is need for collective action 

Voluntary action in large groups do not happen 

# Functions of the government 
(theory of public goods)

Allocation of resources b/w public and private goods 
redistribution (of cash) - subsidisation of a commodity / service is bad as compared to cash transfer
Stabilisation - economy moves in cycle
	Classicists feel employment is always full ..
	Keynesian - in cycle the general equilibrium is unemployment 
		hence a role for government to spend to create aggregate demand and create employment. 
		After full employment - any further expense will cause inflation 
		tradeoff btw unemplyment and inflation
		rigidity in wage.. interest rate → classical do not work 
		marginal efficiency of capital vs rate of interest
		Counter cyclical policy

Redistribution - predominantly by centre 

progressive tax base like -personal income tax corporate tax must be by centre 

Stabilisation - predominantly by the centre - you can not have more than one money supplying authority 

Education, healthcare, water supply n sanitation, law n order → predominantly state 

which level of government has what advantage in each of this function and allocate

# Economic n Demographic profile 
7-8% of GDP as fiscal deficit 

Introduction of TIN.. TDS tracking led to increase in direct tax growth 

Revenue Deficit 
fiscl deficit
primary deficit - deficit entered to in the current year

# Tax Policy in India 

## good tax system
Ability of tax system to reduce inequality is minimum
	inequality can improve if income of both rich and poor come down and the income of rich come down faster than that of the poor.
	but the poor does not have a cushion
so the focus of equity should be abolition of poverty rather than reduction of inequality 
	if abolition of poverty is the goal, the instrument should be the expenditure side of the budget.
	if we use tax exemption as a tool, rich is also benefitted and in relative term the poor might get benefitting more but in absolute term rich may be benefitting more  
	so no need to have a massive exception list
## foundation of tax policy
1. broaden the base
	have minimum exemptions - 
2. Reduce Rates
	high tax - tax evasion / tax avoidance became legitimate 
3. Reduce rate differences
4. simple predictable and transparent tax system

In India tax GDP ratio is much below the potential 
- agricultural tax
- multiple objective for tax 
	- Equity
	- incentive for saving 
	- insurance
	- small scale industries, SEZ, 
	- infra investment 
	- NE State
	- accelerated depreciation 
	You go on narrowing the tax base
	complex tax system 

### Optimal tax theory 
no difference btw indirect and direct tax ~~regressive and progressive tax~~
indirect tax wedge between producer and consumer prices
direct tax a wedge between work and leisure 

the extension of distortion you create os square of the tax rate

#### Cost of Tax
Administrative
Compliance 
Distortion

# Macroeconomics
Deficit 
The total money available for borrowing is provided by the household savings. 
Govt n Corporate are net borrowers. Surplus only with the household. 
Only house holders save in both physical n financial asset.  only the financial asset is available for borrowing.

more borrowing - crowding out effect 
if the money is not used for productive use - inter generational equity question. 
more borrowing - more rate 
credit rating 

Message from the book 
	- State intervention - prism of opportunity cost
	- State intervention ONLY when markets fail 
	- state intervention need not entail public spending. Public spending only when public service is provided 
	- State intervention complementary to market function
	- have important role in human development - in populous country - Externality 
	- technology has changed the nature of public goods so review of states role from time to time - electricity, telecom, natural monopolies
	- provision of public services does not require production
	- focus should be on outcomes and not outlays
	- high mobility of capital and capital embodied labour has limited the capacity to tax them. The tax on capital might turn out to be a tax on labour (unemployment) in open economies. _equity should be pursued more through the expenditure side of the budget_
	- Political economy considerations reduce the time horizon in policy making. Preference for borrowing transfers the burden to the unenfranchised. Financial repression. 
	- Redistribution is better done through cash transfer rather than subsidization
	- need to consider the general equilibrium effects of tax and expenditure policies in calibrating the budgetary policy
		lesser demand for car due to high tax will affect the upstream labour, downstream service etc
