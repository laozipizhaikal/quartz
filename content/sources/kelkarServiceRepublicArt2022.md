> The state can demand certain behaviour, and threaten violence against private persons who refuse to comply. The state can demand tax payments from the populace, backed by threats of violence against people who do not comply. The tax rates can vary based on the situation. Private persons overproduce things that impose negative externalities (such as pollution) and underproduce things that impose positive externalities; modifications to tax rates can help improve the outcome. The state can choose to spend tax revenues in two ways. It can run state organizations such as the police, which produce certain public goods. Or, it can transfer money to private persons. These transfers can be linked to market failure (e.g., using education vouchers to address the externalities in education) or they can be pure redistribution

Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.

There is a tension at the core, where problems of coordination are not easily solved through the tool of coercion. Some people might like to have a paternalistic government. Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will make some people happy at the expense of others. Paternalism by the government is an impossibility.

> The three key steps in policy thinking are:1. Are we facing a market failure? If not, there is no role for the state. 2. Does the proposed intervention address this market failure? Sometimes, we see proposed solutions which do not address the claimed problem. 3. Do we have the ability to effectively implement the proposed intervention? Many times, an idea might be sound but, under present capacity constraints, the implementation of the proposed intervention may be infeasible

> Summing upWhen faced with a potential government intervention, it is useful to ask three key questions. Is there a market failure? Does the proposed intervention address the identified market failure? Do we have the ability to implement the proposed intervention? A disciplined approach of carefully walking through these three steps will result in improved economic policy thinking. It adds up to a powerful and non-trivial toolkit for thinking about the world. There are four classes of errors in Indian public policy that call for reform: (a) Situations where freedom works well, where the right thing for the government is to do nothing but the government is doing something; (b) A market failure is present, but the politics pointed state power in the wrong direction; (c) A market failure is present, the politics worked out right, but

> the wrong intervention was chosen; (d) A market failure is present, the right intervention was chosen, but the implementation was lacking. A successful political system is one which is able to navigate this minefield. It should hold back from engaging in interventions where there is no market failure. It should be able to channel democratic politics away from the traps of populism or special interest group politics. It should be able to foster expertise in understanding problems and devising the right solutions. And finally, it should have the execution capacity of translating the right idea into a successful execution.

> In an ideal world, the state is a benevolent actor, which establishes the right priorities, and is able to marshal the resources to achieve good outcomes. This is not the world that we live in. Public policy in India is characterized by a great deal of failure. We tend to establish the wrong objectives, and then we tend to fail on achieving these objectives. What are the sources of state failure in India?1. The resource constraint: Each rupee of state expenditure in India is likely to come at a cost of Rs 3 for society. 2. The information constraint: Policymakers mostly lack high-quality data about the society in which they seek to operate. 3. The knowledge constraint: Public policy is a research process, and we in India lack the foundations of knowledge for operating this research process. 4. The administrative constraint: We fare poorly at resolving the principal–agent problem between the individual and the state. We must approach politics without romance. Politicians and officials pursue their self-interest. 5. The voter rationality constraint: Individuals lack the incentive to think about policy problems, and organize themselves to influence the policy process.

> The task of public policy research is to identify the formal rules which have incentive implications for the behaviour of officials and politicians. When the rules change, the culture will change. Politicians and officials respond to incentives. This has a big and optimistic implication. Changes in the rules of the game will generate behavioural changes on politicians and officials also. The behaviour of politicians and officials is also malleable. The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.

When high-powered incentives are introduced, there is the danger of individuals pursuing those incentives to the exclusion of everything else. This can often result in unintended consequences. When incentives are established based on a certain statistical measure, there is a greater risk that this measure will be tampered with. While human beings mostly do well in understanding incentives and doing the best for themselves, the new field of ‘behavioural economics’ has documented many kinds of mistakes that human beings make in understanding information, risk and time.

> Prices are the mechanism through which the market economy adjusts to shocks; by hindering price movement we postpone adjustment. In India, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary have all repeatedly undertaken actions which go against the grain of the price system. These actions are doomed to failure. When the policymaker tries to control the price, this is harmful, and the greatest harm is done when the policymaker tries to control both the price and the quantity. The policymaker should have no opinion on prices and not try to control prices. Policymakers must strengthen their intuition into the working of the price system, and go with the grain. The field of public policy is about identifying and addressing market failure, not controlling prices.

Political economy generally favours the incumbent, and leads us towards stagnation where one industry after another are locked up by a few powerful incumbents. At present, Indian public policy does not give pride of place to competition policy. Far from always promoting competition, many state actions at present hamper competition. Policymakers must constantly use the power of the state to prise open closed systems, to create conditions of extreme competition, and to see the bright side of firm failure. The prolonged survival of a weak firm, based on

> artificial life support, induces negative externalities upon healthy firms. The exit of these ‘zombie firms’ is a positive for the economy. It is likely that business cycle downturns will be shorter, once the bankruptcy process is fully in place. The Indian economy features the coexistence of high-productivity firms that abide by laws with low-productivity firms that violate laws. When law enforcement improves, and weak firms exit, GDP growth will be obtained through reallocation of labour and capital. Creative destruction is not alien to India: for small firms, it is the everyday reality. It is only with the large firms, and the areas connected with government, where competitive dynamics is poor.

They are self-adjusting: When there are remunerative activities, e.g., associated with an agricultural cycle, there would be an automatic reduction in workfare. Finally, they are self-liquidating: Once incomes in a certain region go up, through economic growth, nobody would want to do manual labour at Rs 100/day. Over the years, these programmes would tend to fade away on their own.

> It is hard for the state to be paternalistic as it does not know enough about individuals. Each person is different, and only the individual can choose what is best for herself. When the government tries to be paternalistic, value judgements are made by policymakers which are not amenable to rational discourse. No country solved poverty through redistribution. The first priority of policymakers should be to establish a vibrant market economy, through which the size of the pie grows strongly. After this, taxation can be used to obtain budgetary resources which are then redistributed. Distortions of the market economy, induced in the pursuit of redistribution, hinder GDP growth. That is tantamount to killing the golden goose. Subsidies distort behaviour of recipients. The marginal cost of public funds in India is high. The cost imposed upon the economy for Re 1 of public expenditure is about Rs 3. This implies that subsidy programmes induce a large adverse impact upon the GDP. It is easy to build state capacity for paying out subsidies such as the NREGS; it is hard to build state capacity for public goods such as the police. Competing political parties tend to enlarge subsidy expenditures as a way to win elections. The establishment of large subsidy programmes and the sense of entitlement that tends to arise around them create fiscal risk. Fighting poverty should be the clear objective of one or two anti-poverty programmes. The objective of the remainder of government should be to address market failure, without bringing distributional considerations into the picture.

And even in the extreme, where large numbers of people are involved, some traditional community solutions achieve optimality. When feasible, these pathways are superior to the traditional toolkit of state intervention, as they involve less coercion. The conventional Indian discourse slips into moralizing, into a populist approach that favours the interests of the fishermen over the steel mill. This does not yield the optimal answer.

> Going beyond the qualitative recognition of a market failure, it is important to quantify the benefit that would be obtained for society by addressing the market failure. If the cost–benefit analysis shows that the costs imposed upon society, by the best solution, outweigh the prospective benefits, the cure is worse than the disease. The formal process of cost–benefit analysis helps avoid emotion, respects the interests of persons who have not mobilized to campaign or lobby for their own interests, helps bring long term considerations into the picture, and combats the sunk cost fallacy. Every new policy initiative should be launched with a clear statement of the problem that it seeks to solve, the demonstration that there is a market failure, and the cost–benefit analysis that was used to discover the best intervention. After a few years, it is useful to engage in ex post review, and change course if the original objectives were not met. Cost–benefit analysis is not a science, and there is a significant imprecision in all such estimates. We always see things more clearly in hindsight.

Cost–benefit analysis is required for government intervention into society. It is not essential when doing internal reorganization of government organizations. The laws that give power to government agencies to intervene in society must codify the processes of cost–benefit analysis and ex post review. Through this, it induces an institutionalized application of mind, and improves the quality of work.

Jan Tinbergen’s ‘assignment principle’ teaches us that one policy instrument can only be used for one objective. Monetary policy has only one instrument—the short-term interest rate—and can hence deliver only one objective, e.g., the targeted inflation rate. A great deal of policy confusion in India stems from placing multiple objectives upon policy initiatives. Public choice theory predicts that officials will favour multiple objectives so as to avoid accountability. A publicly stated and clear objective, on each policy initiative, improves the policy process.

> India is a continent, with very high heterogeneity. There is no one answer to policy questions, on most problems. The fact that many Union Territoriesrun by the Union government—work better than many states should not lead us to question decentralization. Decentralization of government helps produce local answers to local problems. The ‘subsidiarity principle’ asserts that a function of government is best performed by the lowest possible level of government where it can be performed. The Constitution of India is imbued with federalism. The evolution of the republic shows an inappropriate extent of centralization, of schemes that are designed by the Union government and rolled out everywhere. The phrase ‘Union government’ is preferable to ‘Central government’ as the latter suggests greater control. Similarly, there is an inappropriate level of control of cities and villages by the capital of the state government. The appropriate role of the Union government lies in coordination problems (e.g., the design of infrastructure networks that cut across states) and in addressing poverty traps where the conventional feedback loops of liberal democracy have broken down. In a truly federal structure, state and local governments will have to design their own schemes. This requires capacity building in public policy at states and cities all over India. For decentralization to work, the political system at the level of the state and the city requires reform, in order to achieve adequate checks and balances and dispersion of power.

> A good society is one in which individuals plan and live on their own terms, in a state of confidence over long time horizons. The purpose of public policy is to create the enabling conditions for such a life. As an example, the right way to structure monetary policy is a formal inflation-targeting system, as it rules out inflation surprises, and makes personal financial planning possible over multi-decade horizons. The best framework of public policy is one in which the state impinges upon the lives of individuals as little as possible. This is not a defence of the status quo. Society can and should evolve, gradually, through the thoughts and actions of the people. The state should not engage in social engineering, i.e., it should take no leadership role in the evolution of society. Non-intrusiveness, stability and order is fostered by better communication. The government must say what it will do and then do what it just said. There should be no surprises.

Participatory policymaking works better than small groups working in secret. The ideal mechanism is to have measurement systems, and make small moves. Based on the feedback from the measurement, the small moves can be refined and modified as part of a larger strategy. Do things that you can undo. Beware of the things that you cannot undo. When the measurement is weak, mistakes will not be caught, and there is a need for greater caution.

Enlightenment values port across the world, but tangible policy designs do not. We must go from a ‘thin description’ of what is done elsewhere in the world to a ‘thick description’, an incentive-based understanding of whyofficials and private persons behave as they do in advanced countries. 3A great deal of what happens in advanced economies relies on an ‘invisible infrastructure’ of state apparatus and checks and balances that is not immediately within view when focusing on a narrow problem of policy. The US SEC does certain things right because the United States Constitution establishes certain protections, but when we focus on how the US SEC works, these foundations tend to be overlooked. To do public policy in the Indian context requires envisioning how a proposed design of an intervention or a government organization will work in the Indian setting, with a deep understanding of the surrounding conditions. We only change one piece of policy at a time, while everything else stays unchanged. We have to find the best given the constraints of the environment. Ground-up design of solutions, from first principles, for the Indian environment will often look different from those seen elsewhere.

Level-3 thinking is grounded in metis, in thinking from the first principles. There are some situations where it is possible for policy thinking in India to free-ride on state capacity outside India.

They need to have a portfolio of policy proposals, backed by teams of experts, with fully articulated planning of actions, anticipated impacts, design of the measurement system to monitor the process on an ongoing basis, identification of the persons negatively impacted, and possibly the design of compensatory transfers to defuse the unhappiness. There is a crucial role for the communication strategy that is put into play from the date the cabinet is formed. In this age of Twitter, ‘communication strategy’ consists of catchy slogans and choice abuse. The true role of communication, however, lies in improving coordination on an economy scale. The political and technocratic leadership must have a shared strategy and shared messaging, through which the full picture is consistently and strongly communicated. This would help align expectations and ensure that private persons change their strategies in ways that are coherent with the strategy of reforms. If there is no strategy in reforms, or if it is not properly communicated to the private sector, businesses and financial investors will make mistakes in the formulation of their strategies, which will result in reduced economic performance. This will increase the time lag between the policy change and its full beneficial impact.Example 24: Cutting the peak customs rate by 5 percentage points every year

> In 2000, the Vajpayee government chose a path : the peak customs rate would drop by 5 percentage points every year. Everyone in the administration understood the strategy and consistently communicated it. At first, there was an uproar from incumbent firms, and the government had to deal with their anger in year 1. From year 2 onward, firms understood that the peak rate was going to be down by an additional 20 percentage points by year 5. This set off India’s firms on paths of fundamental productivity growth, and improved the choice of investment projects. Every step of the way, as customs duties were cut, tradeables in India became cheaper, and this kicked off an export boom. This combination of communication and staggered introduction of the reform induced synchronization between the government and the private sector. This was critical for the economic boom which started in 2003.Before the first yearIn the world of business, there is a balance between building a great product and selling it on the market. An extreme emphasis on a sales and advertising team can yield a brief surge of customer interest, but this does not translate into sustained success if the product is not of high quality and the machinery of production and distribution is not in place. In other words, a firm needs not just sales and advertising, it also needs research, design and operations management. It needs a great product and the capability to produce and distribute the product, on top of which the sales and advertising offensive is essential. There is an analogy with the world of politics. Running an election campaign is analogous to the sales and advertising problem. To win power, this is essential. But if this is all that is done, sustained voter satisfaction will be elusive. Political parties need to prepare to govern, alongside campaigning to get elected. Once the election results are in, every day lost in establishing the team and kicking off a portfolio of reforms is a costly delay. We are doing too little transition planning in Indian politics.

> When out of power, political parties should have a shadow cabinet. There should be a sustained process of engagement with think tanks, academic institutions, data sets and intellectuals, in order to cogitate about what is going wrong. The emphasis in an opposition party should be not just on criticizing what the ruling party has done, but on developing a set of plans for what would be done when in power. The incumbent ruling party equally faces this problem. At year 5, a successful ruling team is jaded, and an unsuccessful ruling team is demoralized. Yet, it needs to think through the possibility of re-election, and find the energy for transition planning. This preparatory work would be particularly valuable when it is fed into the manifesto of the political party and, when coalition governments are formed, the negotiation for a common minimum programme. The paragraphs in such documents matter disproportionately, but receive inadequate attention ahead of time. Long-range thinking and capacity building are required in each political party to develop the capability to succeed in the event of winning elections. When such developmental work is not done, ahead of time, we translate remarkable election outcomes into failures on policy.Playing the long gameA cult of jald baazi is taking root in India. This is the notion that a problem can be understood in a few days, and solved in a few weeks. Powerful policymakers tend to whip up a frenzy of getting things done quickly. Every expert in India has gone through the surreal experience of being ignored for years, and then asked to deliver a reform document overnight.You rush a miracle man, you get a rotten miracle.

> This is a harmful approach. In some rare situations, a team is available in India, which is fully imbued with a problem, has the right understanding, has the right human networks in the country, has learned how to work with each other, and can move at high speed in executing a reform. Even under these conditions, drafting laws and building state capacity takes a long time. In most situations, there is a starvation of intellectual capacity in the country. We lack data, knowledge, experts and teams that know how to work with each other. There is thus a slow process of understanding problems, designing solutions, going up from individuals to teams with esprit de corps, and implementing reforms. The cult of speed yields failure in both cases. Even when the best teams are assembled, if the work which requires two years is compressed into a few months, this will be done badly. With weak teams, the pressure of solving a problem in a few months surely yields failure. There is a pipeline in the policy reform process: data to research to policy proposals to consensus to government decisions to policy implementation. It is not possible to short-circuit this process. Some fields are at a weaker stage, where the basics of data and research are not in place. In these fields, the only horizons over which meaningful policy reform can be achieved are a long time horizon. The cult of speed is ultimately derived from management failure in government. We are faring poorly on establishing institutions which contain harmonious teams that impound information and expertise; we are unable to make long-term plans and stay focused on them. We suffer from a strong pace of personnel changes, which prevent the development of knowledge and rapport within policy teams. We suffer from three-page notes of individual reform measures, typically written by interested parties, which lack strategic thinking. We fluctuate from one topic to another, based on the crises that engulf us each day. When a government flits from one issue to the next based on the news cycle, there is no strategy. It would behove the policy process to be sceptical about the solutions that are hawked in three-page notes, to be slow and cautious. We should set a

There was a great rush in quickly getting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India up and running, and in declaring the IBC open for business. Many corners were cut in getting to a quick launch. By early 2019, we have seen many difficulties in the working of the IBC. The big cases have proved stubbornly hard to process. Consider an alternative history. Would it have made sense to lay the groundwork from May 2016 to May 2018, and only then declare the IBC open for business? We suspect that things would have looked better by early 2019, if that slow path had been taken.Example 26: The Rhine was not cleaned in a dayIn 1986, a blast at the Sandoz chemical plant in Basel, Switzerland, leaked tonnes of toxic chemicals in the Rhine, Europe’s longest river. The 1233km-long transboundary river, passes through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and Holland. This presented complex multination problems of policy coordination, in order to clean the river. In 1987, the Rhine Action Plan was drawn up, with a simple and bold target: By the year 2000, there would be salmon in the Rhine again. The implementation plan employed a variety of measures and instruments to clean the river—from expanding and equipping biological sewage treatment plants, to working with non-profits like Greenpeace to monitor emissions levels, and industrial regulation and enforcement. While the original plan had a bold target of an outcome in thirteen years, in reality, it took thirty years and 45 billion Euros, and the fish were back.

They know that building a bridge is expensive, that it requires professionals to build, that there will be a project plan, that many steps have to be undertaken, and these take time, and only then can a bridge be inaugurated. The same approach is required with state capacity! When a new government organization is required: (a) It will be expensive; (b) It requires professionals to build it; (c) There must be a formal project plan in order to build the organization and its capabilities; and (d) Implementing this project plan will take time. Only when the project is completed, can a new organization be declared open for business. We have repeatedly seen new organizations being launched in the Indian state in a casual and informal way. The present ways—of hiring a few people and declaring a government agency open for business within a very short time horizon—are downright harmful. Right at the outset, the organization is crushed with demands that it is ill-prepared for. The fledgling organization is underfunded and under-resourced in every possible way. It gets into a firefighting mindset, makes mistakes, and generally never recovers from the early failures. We in India have learned how infrastructure projects require time and money. We need to carry this professional approach into building statecapacity in government organizations. 2The equity market reform started at the G.S. Patel Committee report in 1984. A humble researcher in this team, R.H. Patil, was central to the establishment of NSE. SEBI was begun as a non-statutory organization in 1988. The pieces of the equity market fell into place by 2001. There was an exciting journey of ideas and action, with the establishment of SEBI, NSE

> and NSDL, which ran from 1984 to 2001. This gave fundamental progress in the equity market. We may have thought that once completed, this would stand in place. In the event, there was a dissipation of the institutional memory. The experiences of the 1980s and 1990s, which shaped decisions of the 1990s, were forgotten. In numerous aspects, there has been a retreat in the capabilities of the financial markets in the recent decade. As an example, the first settlement failure in the history of the NSE, and the first settlement failure in the Indian equity market after a gap of nineteen years, took placein 2019. 3Similarly, the pension reforms began with Project OASIS, led by Surendra Dave, in 1998. This led up to the decision in December 2002 to implement the New Pension System (NPS) for new recruits into the government. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) was set up, and the law enshrining PFRDA was only enacted in 2013. However, there was a dissipation of the institutional memory. The experiences of the 1990s, and the logic of the NPS, were forgotten in many important ways. These experiences underline the importance of building stable teams which are able to engage with the reforms process over long time horizons. Each area of work is a complex problem with many moving parts. As policy projects unfold over long time horizons, we require teams and policy continuity over long time horizons. When staffing is unstable, and when institutional memory is lost, we lose ground.Building the republic takes timeIt took hundreds of years to build the US, the UK and the other mature liberal democracies of the world. As an example, the US Constitution was written in 1776, but the ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine—which is absolutely fundamental to limiting the power of investigative agenciesonly came together in the early twentieth century, i.e., 154 years after the

> founding of the country. It was only in the 1970s that US lawmakers shut off domestic operations by the CIA, and brought electronic surveillance by investigative agencies under the rule of law. Similarly, it took seventy years from 1947 for India to decriminalize gay sex. Assuming there is progress towards freedom and the rule of law in the future, it will prove to take over seventy years to get to basic elements of civil liberties including decriminalization of defamation, removal of sedition from the IPC, and placing electronic surveillance of the populace under a rule of law framework. These are long and slow journeys. We should not look for the newspaper headlines, the quick wins, the buzz on social media. We should instead dig into the long and slow process of genuinely building the republic.Summing upWhen a policy reform takes place, the full gains are obtained through the reallocation of resources in the economy. Policy reform requires private persons to fully internalize the new environment, and re-optimize for it. Many policy reforms require the construction of institutional capacity within government and in the economy. These adjustments take time. For this reason, the pain is front-loaded and the gains come with a lag. Policymakers need to understand who will lose in the short run, negotiate with them, and find compromises with them. After elections take place, and the leadership faces a five-year horizon, it is useful to think of year 1 as the time to launch complex initiatives, which will mature through years 2, 3 and 4, and show positive impacts by year 5. This imposes demands on the team formed after the elections. It needs to choose the major projects, staff them, and communicate this to the economy so as to reshape expectations. This requires considerable work within political parties before winning the election. Such thinking over long time horizons diverges from the cult of speed that is often found in Indian public policy, where three-page notes are

There is a pipeline of the policy process, from measurement all the way to policy execution. The institutional memory of each field is contained in a community of intellectuals and policy practitioners. The pipeline and the community need to be nurtured, in order to play the long battles of policy reform. We in India now know that a bridge across a river is a project that has to go through certain steps. It takes time, money and professional capacity in order to build a bridge. We have to see policy reforms in a similar way. There is no short cut from the date on which it is decided that a bridge shall be built, to the date on which the bridge is inaugurated. Building the republic takes time. It will take many decades of hard work by the policy community for India to rise to the ranks of the advanced nations of the world. Policy reform is slow, hard work, and not amenable to quick wins on social media.

> 20What is hard and what is easyWhen we think of a given government intervention, we need to judge how hard it would be for successful implementation. Suppose the Indian state is evaluating a universal human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization programme for children. While we know that this is hard, it is in the zone of feasible policy pathways. But suppose the Indian state is evaluating a programme where officials will interview unemployed individuals and decide which of them should get welfare payments every month. This seems beyond the reach of the implementation capacity of the Indian state. What are the general principles through which we can engage in such reasoning?Four dimensions of complexityLant Pritchett and Michael Woolcock first posed this question and offeredelements of the answer. 1 They predict that implementation is hard whenthere is more discretion and when there are a larger number of transactions. In addition, implementation is harder when there is more at stake for private persons, and when there is more secrecy. Number of transactions: It is easier to achieve state capacity on a problem where there are a smaller number of transactions. A vast sprawling machinery involves greater agency problems; it is difficult to be sure that every element of the administrative machine is working correctly. Discretion: It is easier to achieve state capacity when there is low discretion. An immunization programme is a good example, where there is

> a population-scale outreach, but the work that has to be done by each civil servant is fixed and there is no discretion. Stakes: It is harder to achieve state capacity when there is more at stake for private persons. Problems like the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation are the hardest puzzles. Here, the decisions of state agents have enormous consequences for individuals, and private persons will devote considerable effort in trying to influence the outcome. Secrecy: The bulk of the working of the Ministry of Rural Development takes place in the open. Policy documents and data sets come out into the public domain. This makes the feedback loops of analysis and criticism more effective. In contrast, the secrecy that surrounds a ministry, such as the Ministry of Defence, can serve as a cloak for poor performance.Example 27: Monetary policy is easy, financial regulation is hardBy this reasoning, monetary policy is a relatively easy problem:Low discretion: Once inflation targeting is embedded in the law, there is a clear accountability mechanism. Individuals who make the decision have relatively limited discretion. Individuals who make flagrantly wrong decisions will be exposed in public and will suffer lifetime reputational damage. Low number of transactions: There is no citizen-facing part to monetary policy. It is only four to six decisions a year. Low stakes: Raising or lowering the policy rate has important consequences for the economy as a whole but it is of extreme importance, at a personal level, to nobody. Not much is at stake as far as private persons are concerned; there will be relatively little tangible lobbying or pressure in trying to influence the outcome. It is interesting to see that when the monetary policy transmission is weak, the stakes are even lower, as small changes in the policy rate have a negligible impact upon the economy. It is easier to establish

> independence of the central bank under conditions of a weak monetary policy transmission. Low secrecy: A sound central bank has essentially zero secrecy, so there is the full potency of analysis and criticism in the public domain, thus giving strong feedback loops from failure to improvement.Hence, monetary policy is a relatively easy puzzle in state capacity building. A small elite is required that writes the rules of the game, that gets the country up to a modern central banking law. A small elite is required which mans the monetary policy committee. Central banks can be fairly small, lean organizations. The complexity of solving principal–agent problems in a large organization can be avoided. In contrast, financial regulation is a difficult problem. A lot of behaviour lies in the shades of grey; there is discretion for the investigator and the prosecutor in classifying a certain activity as a violation or not. There are a large number of transactions; there are thousands of financial firms and there is a requirement for perhaps a thousand investigators and prosecutors in India. The stakes are sky high. How regulations are drafted and enforced makes a difference of trillions of rupees in terms of the payoffs to private persons. Billionaires have a great incentive to reshape the working of financial regulation in their favour, and they will use every trick in the book in trying to impact on the policy process. There is a good deal of secrecy. Supervision, investigations, enforcement and the quasi-judicial process of financial regulators is cloaked in a good deal of secrecy. Hence, financial regulation is a difficult problem in constructing statecapacity. 2Solutions that reduce complexity in some dimensions

> There is a great deal of optimism about the extent to which modern IT solves problems of governance. We are able to see one zone where IT systems are truly transformational: in the removal of discretion. As an example, when there is an IT system through which railway tickets are sold, the discretion of the front line sales person is eliminated. IT systems ease the construction of state capacity by offering processengineering through which discretion can be removed. 3 This is a recurringtheme running across many great opportunities for utilising IT in buildingstate capacity. 4Example 28: Judicial reformsIn the working of courts and tribunals, there are two distinct elements which can be seen as pillars of intervention. There is the highly discretionintensive problem of the thinking of the judge. Alongside this, there is the low-discretion and transaction-intensive problem of running the operational processes of the court. This is also termed ‘the registry’ of the court. It is possible to bring modern business process re-engineering into the working of the operational procedures. This approach is likely to give substantial gains in the operational efficiency of courts, while leaving theindependence of the judiciary intact. 5This is a useful vertical split, between high-discretion and low-discretion parts of the working of a court. Using modern IT systems, the lowdiscretion part can be rapidly transformed.Solutions that change from one dimension of complexity to anotherMany government offices in India find it difficult to achieve clean toilets. Cleaning the toilets is a transaction-intensive problem, which calls for

> considerable state capacity in being able to recruit and manage a cleaning crew. This is a well-defined service function, which does not involve the use of coercive power upon the people, and hence it can be contracted out. Our first impulse might thus be: Why not replace tenured janitors who do not clean the toilets by a private contractor who will not give tenure to her employees? This appears to offer gains in one dimension: We are replacing a transaction-intensive function (janitors cleaning) by a small number of transactions (procuring and monitoring the private contractor). In the process, however, we do run up to larger stakes. A tenured janitor gains about Rs 150,000 a year (her wage) from doing no work. In contrast, a private contractor that undertakes cleaning services for an entire building may be paid Rs 1.5 crore (Rs 15 million) a year. The private contractor now stands to gain a bigger amount by doing no work. The stakes are higher. It now requires a large amount of state capacity, albeit in a different dimension, to ensure the contract goes to the right person, using a fair process, and is adequately monitored. When PPP was first proposed as a way to improve upon low-quality infrastructure built by government departments, this was hailed as a big step forward. With the benefit of hindsight, we see that PPP contracting is hard, as the stakes are high.The four hardest problemsThe criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation suffer from the problem of high discretion, high number of transactions, very high stakes and varying amounts of secrecy. How the front-line policeman behaves can make a difference of life and death for a person. This gives extreme discretionary power to the policeman. The hardest problems in state capacity are the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation.

> Learn to walk before you runOnce we see that high stakes harm the construction of state capacity, a natural tool for sequencing is to initially start at low stakes. If the fine for driving through a red light is Rs 10,000, there will be pervasive corruption. Jobs in the highway police will be sought after; large bribes will be paid to obtain these jobs. There will be an institutional collapse of the highway police. It is better to first start with a fine of Rs 100, and build state capacity. Once a country has learned how to run a highway police at a fine of Rs 100, we can think of going up to larger fines. A low tax rate induces low stakes. High tax rates are a high load upon the state, as the personal incentives of tax administrators (to take bribes) become highly divergent from the objectives of the institutions that they represent. Public anger about the failures of the criminal justice system in India has often given a sharp escalation of punishments. This leads to higher stakes, and thus reduces the capability of the criminal justice system. When we are at the early stages of learning how to be a state, it is wise to start out at low stakes (e.g., low tax rates, low punishments). Once capabilities are fully established, there can be a mature debate about whether the right policy pathways involve higher stakes (e.g., higher taxrates, higher punishments). 6Summing upWhen we face a problem in public policy, it is important to assess how difficult it will be, to build the requisite state capacity. Four factors shape this:1. Transaction intensity: If something involves a large number of transactions, by a large number of front-line civil servants, it is harder.

Secrecy: When there is greater secrecy, it is harder.Monetary policy is easy while financial regulation is hard because the latter involves a larger number of transactions, a greater use of discretion, high stakes and greater secrecy. Complexity in this four-dimensional space is not immutable. We can often undertake actions that reduce the complexity in some of these dimensions or trade off complexity in one dimension for another dimension. The four hardest problems are the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and the financial regulation. They suffer from high transactions, high discretion, high stakes and high secrecy. If a government organization is asked to suddenly achieve capability on a difficult problem, it will collapse in an organizational rout. A natural way to sequence the construction of state capacity is to first start with an easier problem, to achieve success, and then escalate the complexity. At an early stage in the republic, it will help to reduce discretion, reduce secrecy and most importantly, reduce the stakes. At first, agencies should be given low powers to investigate and the punishments that can be awarded should be low. This will create better conditions for achieving state capacity.

> 21Confident policymakers work in the openIn public policy, we don’t just dine with friends, we must also sup with fiends. Ashok DesaiThere is a long tradition of secrecy in public policy in India. Too often, in India, a reform is pushed through as a sudden fait accompli upon the losers. As the complexity of the economy has grown, and as Indian democracy has matured, it is increasingly unwise to maintain this level of secrecy.Secrecy harms planning and executionExposing early drafts to the persons who have a lot at stake may often yield improvements in the work. Particularly when we have low state capacity, the most well-meaning reform is often marred by technical mistakes in the execution. A more open policy process catches more errors and it improves the resulting work. As an example, most draft laws in India are faulty owing to gaps in capabilities for drafting law in government organizations and in their supporting law firms. A thorough and genuine process of consultation will find mistakes. One of the reasons why the demonetization decision suffered from difficulties of policy design and implementation was the secrecy in which it was surrounded. The areas of Indian public policy which are shrouded in secrecy (military, intelligence, trading in the RBI treasury) may have the biggest flaws.

> The full gains from a reform require a great deal of advance planning and preparation by myriad private persons. This developmental work takes place if there is ample advance warning. The same reform will deliver better results if the overall economy has been primed for the idea adequately.Losers from a reform require fair warningEvery reform hurts certain firms and certain persons. With more advance warning, they can plan their life better. This would reduce the costs for the economy as a whole. As an example, consider the simplest reform: trade liberalization. Certain Indian factories, in areas where India does not have a comparative advantage, have to close down when the trade liberalization is done. We as a country have two choices: to present them with a surprise big-bang trade liberalization, or to talk about it every step of the way and give ample warning. By giving ample warning, for many years, firms will cut back on investments in physical capital and organizational capital into the businesses that are not going to survive trade liberalization. This reduces the destruction of capital that always accompanies trade liberalization.The policy process is one of negotiationThere is a valuable political economy perspective upon this question, where we see all reforms as a process of negotiation. Healthy democracies are those where various interest groups are able to sit together, engage in discourse in good faith, and emerge with reasonable compromises. The essential foundation for the democratic process of negotiation is trust—a certain presumption of good faith. We as a society need to experience decades upon decades of decent behaviour with each other, in order to learn how to trust each other to

> negotiate in good faith. This will yield a political system in which we are able to rise above partisan hatred and enter into bargains that make everyone better off. The trust building that is required for this is hampered when policy measures are hatched in secrecy and suddenly unveiled upon the populace. The persons who get hurt feel that they were not treated fairly. This adversely affects the trust capital of the country, and holds back our emergence as a mature political system.Give people time to change behaviourLet us go back to the example of trade liberalization. So far, we have emphasized the presence of people who lose from the reform. But sheer fairness requires that they need to be able to plan for this ahead of time. But the full impact upon the economy works through a series of adaptations. Some of the affected firms may choose to wind down their business or sell it. Others will choose to push up their productivity. Some firms that use goods that have lower tariffs will now see new opportunities to make things for the local or overseas market, as a consequence of lower prices. This may, in turn, kick off technological changes. The full impact of a policy measure plays out in reshaping the work of the private sector. It is better for this work to commence as early as possible. For this reason, an open and consultative process works better. If private persons have ample warning, their adaptations commence at an earlier date. Through this, the lags of the policy process are reduced. The gains for the economy are obtained in a shorter period. It is easy to deride ‘paralysis through analysis’. For many people who are not instinctively comfortable with intellectual discourse, the slow process of public debates and government committees seems like a waste of time. Reaching out to critics is tactically costly as this increases the say that critics have in stalling or subverting a reform. The authoritarian impulse, to favour action over talk, is fashionable.

> However, the best policy work gets done in the open. The participatory policy process, grounded in intellectual debate, generates a better reforms process. It helps avoid a policy process that is pure power play. The work is better rooted in the landscape of people and institutions. The mistakes are more likely to be taken out. The negotiations and compromises create support and legitimacy. Policy implementation works out better.Example 29: Petroleum reforms, the ‘R group’An example of this is the ‘R Group’ which worked on petroleum policy reform starting in 1995. This involved all parties to the thinking, worked in the open, negotiated short-term vs long-term elements of the reform, and laid the foundations of an important and successful reform. A group of young leaders from public sector oil companies—all below age thirty—was formed, to prepare a road map to international competitiveness. The idea was that these individuals had a long-term stake in the success of the reform, and would be less invested in the present ways. This was termed the ‘below thirty group’. The ‘R group’ was set up under the chairmanship of the secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas (Vijay Kelkar). The members were the leaders of public sector and private sector firms, and independent experts. Multiple conferences took place with the leaders of trade unions on the benefits from the liberalization programme chosen by the ‘below thirty group’. The reforms began by replacing administered prices by international oil prices, for all upstream companies including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). This was coupled with competition in new exploration. ONGC simultaneously got better revenues and greater competition. ONGC also got the freedom to operate in the world, just like any large oil company would. The next step was open competition in the downstream industry, along with replacing the cost-plus pricing regime by international parity pricing.
> ^CECPNHI8aLHYLNIRLp178

> [!note] Page 179
> 
> This was introduced sequentially. It began with industrial inputs such as naphtha and fuel oil, and then for transportation fuels such as petrol and diesel, and finally for the household fuels, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Finally, the price of natural gas was linked to international fuel oil prices, instead of a cost-plus pricing regime. This entire story took place over a six-year period. It led to increased investments in upstream, midstream and downstream sectors, productivity gains and higher accretion of domestic oil and gas reserves. There was no political friction in this process. As the reforms were extensively discussed, there were no unpleasant shocks either to consumers or to producers, and the gains for consumers and for trade unions outweighed the pain. The entry of private firms was done through carefully designed auction procedures, so as to avoid accusations of corruption.Example 30: Inflation targetingInflation targeting was talked about by some intellectuals in the early years of the first decade of the millennium, as a response to the difficulties that RBI was then facing with monetary policy. This public debate at an intellectual level led to the first recommendation in a government committee report by Percy Mistry, titled ‘Mumbai as an international financial centre’ (MIFC), in 2007. This was followed by a similar recommendation in Raghuram Rajan’s report in 2009. This was followed by a draft law for inflation targeting by Justice Srikrishna’s ‘Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission’. There was a great deal of debate in newspaper columns, blog articles, research papers and conference panels. This was followed by an RBI committee, headed by Urjit Patel, which also recommended that inflation targeting be adopted. The implementation was done in two steps: first, the ‘Monetary Policy Framework Agreement’ that was signed between the finance secretary, Rajiv Mehrishi, and the RBI governor, Raghuram Rajan,

> on 20 February 2015, and next, the amendment to the RBI Act in February 2016. This was not a small reform. This was the biggest milestone in RBI’s history. It is fitting that alongside the introduction of a 4 per cent consumer price index (CPI) target into the RBI Act, the text in the preamble to the RBI Act which established the RBI in 1934 as ‘a temporary measure’ was simultaneously deleted. This was a long and slow journey for the RBI—from a temporary measure in 1934 to the first intellectual clarity in the early years of the millennium to the modified RBI Act in 2016. Policymakers developed a strategy and gradually executed it, in a completely open process, to the point where, at the end, it was an inevitable non-event.From date of announcement to date effectiveFrom these points of view, it is particularly important to ensure there is a substantial lag between the date of a policy announcement and the date on which it becomes effective. One of the most harmful things that is taking place in the Indian state is announcements that show up on a website in the evening, without any previous notice, and are effective next morning. These impose huge costs upon private persons, and drive up the ex ante fear of policy risk in the minds of firms.Professional capabilities in public policyThere is a pattern in the Indian story, where weak policy teams tend to operate in a more secretive way. There seems to be a lack of confidence in being able to win arguments in the public domain. The weakest ideas are hatched in secrecy and suddenly sprung upon the economy.

> This is related to the problems of knowledge partnerships and the comfort with intellectual discourse. The best policy teams in India are well connected into intellectual capabilities, are comfortable with criticism, and are able to debate with their critics as part of the public discourse. Weak policy teams are more likely to be disconnected from intellectual capabilities, work in secrecy, react in a hostile way to criticism, and deliver poor results in policymaking. When a policy team is comfortable with articulating and debating a reform in public, and listens to other points of view in order to engage in a process of iterative refinement, this sends a signal to private persons that there is genuine capability in the policy process. This improves the legitimacy of the policy process and increases optimism that good work will be done.Summing upGood debate to good debate, knowledge grows. Ancient Sanskrit proverbSecrecy harms policy planning and execution. In a liberal democracy, the relationship between the policymaker and the individual is not the relationship between a ruler and a subject. The policy process is a process of negotiation. The losers from a reform require fair warning. When there is ample warning, the adaptations of the private sector kick in early, and the gains for the economy are obtained in a shorter time. Confident policymakers work in the open. Working in the open signals capability. The most harmful events are those where a policy announcement shows up on a website in the evening, without any prior warning, and is effective next morning. The best episodes are those with an open consultative process, where the legal instrument showing up on the website is a non-

> 22Criticism and conflict have great valueYour critic should live right next door.Sant TukaramOur traditional self-image of India consists of seeing us as a healthy liberal democracy. There are, however, many disturbing features which have crept in gradually. As an example, we may think that India has a free press, but India is now ranked 140th out of 180 countries on press freedom, by Reporters Without Borders. As a consequence, there is much less criticism of the establishment than is required. As policymakers, we tend to develop a point of view. We should, however, be humble. We are not omniscient, and we are frequently wrong. It is wise to listen to our critics as they are likely to often be right.Good for fairness, good for self-interestA healthy democracy is one in which diverse points of view are able to engage in civil discussions, engage in give-and-take, and search for common ground. Critics see the world from diverse points of view. All these points of view are legitimate elements of the democratic process of negotiation and compromise. In this point of view, acceptance of criticism is integral to norms of good behaviour in liberal democracy, and is a noble thing.

> Respecting and valuing criticism is not just about fair play. As the Marathi aphorism by Sant Tukaram at the beginning of the chapter says, it is also about the self-interest of the policymaker. As our information and wisdom are always limited, it is useful to have people in our midst, who will identify mistakes in our reasoning. Neuroscientists have described a phenomenon called ‘the power paradox’: persons who possess power appear to become more impulsive, less risk-aware, and less adept at seeing things from other people’s point ofview. 1 This makes mistakes more likely. Encouraging and respectingcriticism is the key path to avoiding hubris. Another dimension of the gains from nurturing criticism is related to the idea of crossing the river by feeling the stones, using feedback loops. The best way to make progress is to take small steps, and to listen to the statistical evidence. A distributed system of criticism can tap into a larger knowledge base, and create valuable feedback through which course corrections at intermediate stages can be achieved. The peculiar twist in India is that in many areas, the statistical system is weak. We are down to gathering anecdotal evidence by talking to people. No one individual can talk with a large number of people. Each critic is valuable insofar as she represents information from a different subset of the system under examination. Critics of public policy strategies are a valuable part of society, and essential for the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones. The critic is not a bad human being; the critic is not an enemy; he is someone who has given you free advice that helps strengthen your work.We must love them both, those whose opinions we share and those whose opinions we reject, for both have labored in the search for truth, and both have helped us in finding it.St. Thomas AquinasWe need not agree with our critics, but our critics can help us see the flaws in our thinking and make improvements. We should not attack critics, and we should not encourage sycophants. We should foster an intellectual landscape featuring honest analysis and discussion. When person X praises

> the policymaker and person Y criticizes the policymaker, it is more useful for the policymaker to meet person Y and understand the logic of the criticism. This conversation may result in course corrections. In an environment where critics are attacked and harmed, these feedback loops will be harmed. The government will then encourage sycophants, who will always praise the government. Mid-course corrections will not take place. Lacking in the support system of criticism, the government will stumble from one mistake to the next. Authoritarian regimes, that neglected the value of feedback, have repeatedly failed in the human experience of thousands of years.Conflict in the public domain is the healthy stateAuthoritarian regimes look well organized and powerful, like the clean formations in a military parade. There is a great leader, and everyone is deferential to the positions of the great leader and the inner circle of power. Once a position is taken, everyone falls in line, in public, with a great deal of flattery. The great leader is incapable of making mistakes and must always be praised. There are disagreements and conflicts, of course, but they take place outside the public gaze, and tend to degenerate into pure power play.No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition. Benjamin DisraeliThe absence of a true opposition has led to the rapid deterioration of democracy into a kind of totalitarianism.C. Rajagopalachari 2In contrast, democracies look messy. They are riven with debate, dissension, and a tug of war. Power is dispersed across many individuals and many elements of the government. Neutral and intellectual voices weigh in on the conflicts that are played out in the public domain.
> ^GIZ8GA8RaLHYLNIRLp185

> [!note] Page 186
> 
> This policy process is a world of ideas and rational thinking, and not merely an exercise in power play. The continuous debate in an environment of dispersed power is the reason why democracies work well. The continuous process of criticism and debate finds and solves mistakes. In the best of times, most people are greatly influenced by voices around them. On most subjects, we do not have deep expertise, and tend to go with the mainstream. Conversely, if novel proposals are not vigorously contested, there is the danger of oddball ideas taking root. This problem is particularly seen in authoritarian countries. When the establishment takes a certain position, and there is a great deal of sycophantic applause, the climate of opinion shifts. This is also why authoritarian governments work badly. When we think about criticizing the government, it is important to see that government is not a monolithic creature. Government is made up of many individuals and agencies, all of which have different points of view. Criticism of the stated position of an agency generally strengthens the hand of the reformers within the agency. An environment where all criticism is attacked or proscribed is a recipe for policy paralysis. The really important initiatives will never achieve traction without an extensive reshaping of the larger discourse, in which criticism of the status quo is of central importance. In some ideal world, government is like a nice NGO. Everyone is imbued with a shared sense of what is good for the people, and all cooperate in harmoniously building a utopia. Conflicts melt away because everyone appeals to the common good. This is an idealized world of agitprop documentaries. Public choice theory encourages us to see that everyone involved in government works for herself, and all policymaking is marred by conflicts. Conflict is the normal state, and we should not be uncomfortable about it. Differences between persons and agencies are normal and healthy, and should be played out in the public domain. Differences arise out of conflicting interests, differences in information sets, and legitimate differences in how information is analysed.
> ^RASAI6XPaLHYLNIRLp186

> 
> The protagonists of a conflict criticize each other. The media creates rancour by playing up conflict. We should disagree in polite language, maintain good personal relationships, and work through formal procedures for resolving conflicts. But we should be comfortable with conflict as the normal state. In fact, it is only in an authoritarian regime that conflict is squelched, as persons are too fearful to speak up. If two people agree on everything, only one is doing the thinking.The under-supply of criticismWe must recognize that in every society, there is a market failure in the form of an under-supply of criticism. Criticizing the government imposes costs upon the critic. The gains from criticism are diffused; the entire society benefits from the criticism. The self-interest of the critic leads her to ignore the gains forsociety at large, and thus to under-supply criticism. 3In July 2018, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing wrote a tough review of the hard-line policies of Xi Jinping, the revival of communist orthodoxy and the adulatory propaganda surrounding Xi Jinping and the regime. Prof. Xu Zhangrun’s essay has text such as: ‘People nationwide, including the entire bureaucratic elite, feel once more lost in uncertainty about the direction of the country and about their own personal security, and the rising anxiety has spread into a degree of panic throughout society.’ Such writing by intellectuals is the essence of building a civilized society, and imposes positive externalities upon the Chinese populace. However, Prof. Xu Zhangrun is alone in facing the attacks from the regime. He has been suspended, barred from teaching, investigated andbarred from leaving the country. 4 The externalities do not accrue to XuZhangrun, while the costs do. A few academics are courageous and speak up like this, but most would prefer silence.

> This is similar to the standard economics argument about individual incentive leading to an underinvestment in higher education, as the decision maker does not value the spillovers, the positive externalities for society at large. When an Andrei Sakharov goes up against a regime, the critic instantly earns respect. When an individual goes up against a billionaire, the details are more intricate, billionaires are able to resort to tactics that governments cannot employ, and there is less moral clarity. There will thus be an even greater under-supply of criticism of billionaires. In a village economy, everyone knows everyone else, and economic relationships are efficiently organized under conditions of high information. In a modern market economy, however, many key relationships take place under substantial asymmetric information. In an environment where information is suppressed, there is greater fear about what lies beneath. This hampers trust and arm’s-length relationships. As an example, in 2012, the research firm Veritas Investment Research Corporation wrote a research report about a firm. Two years later, the authors of the report were taken into custody by the Gurgaon police. After such an event, arm’s-length investors became more concerned about the possibility that there is bad news about firms in India that is not being honestly revealed into the public domain.Voting turns conflict into better decisionsConsider a formal or informal meeting where multiple persons, with diverse interests, come into a room to make a decision. How can the conflict be channelled most effectively, so that the knowledge and the interests of all persons in the room are well represented and a good compromise is obtained? When multiple viewpoints come to the table, they are normally intermediated by informal systems of power. The persons in the room are all in a repeated game, and there is a give and take across many different
> ^UCHRUJBUaLHYLNIRLp188

> [!note] Page 189
> 
> elements of these relationships. It is all too easy for this process to collapse into an autocratic arrangement, where all power is placed with one or two people. Our cultural mores in India tend to give disproportionate power to the oldest or richest person in the room. The give and take which occurs in these informal meetings is part of a larger game between these individuals. A person may sacrifice the interests of a certain constituency in one particular meeting in return for pay-offs in unrelated settings. Each person who gets a seat on the table has the opportunity to non-transparently make certain trade-offs. In the limit, persons in the room sacrifice the interests of constituents or the public interest in return for personal gains. How can conflicts be channelled into better decisions? Formal voting systems are a great tool for improving the quality of the discourse. It is useful to think of three stages of a meeting. Stage 1 is an approximate statement of position, by various persons, and a free-format debate. Stage 2 consists of defining sharp propositions. Stage 3 consists of voting on them. What prevents persons in the room from arranging side payments in exchange for votes? Public disclosure of each vote, with a rationale statement, helps ensuring personal accountability of each person for the position taken. In India, two formal voting systems are in place: benches of judges in the judiciary, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). In the MPC, the stage 2 is clear. Every meeting of the MPC has a narrow range of discrete choices that can be taken. In this case, the propositions that require voting upon are well understood. An MPC meeting then involves only stage 1 and stage 3. The Indian MPC has three votes for RBI staff and three votes for outsiders. When there is a tie, the RBI governor has a casting vote. This suffers from the problem that the two RBI staffers are likely to be deferential towards the third vote, which is the RBI governor’s. Thus, in effect, the governor controls the outcome of the MPC. A better design would have one vote for the RBI governor and four votes for independents. In that design, in order to have her way, the RBI governor would need to
> ^M2LJ3K9TaLHYLNIRLp189

> [!note] Page 190
> 
> persuade at least two out of the four independents. This seems like a healthy reduction in the power of the governor. Decision making through a vote, with genuine dispersion of power, qualitatively improves meetings. When one or two persons dominate a room, others tend to be listless and uninterested. The knowledge and interests of all person are not vigorously brought into the room. When a certain set of persons have a vote each, each of them is fully energized to participate in the discussion, knowing that she has equal power and that her vote counts. This improves the very discussion that precedes the vote. When a meeting ends in a vote, everyone in the room thinks better and participates more. This idea can be used in a wide variety of meetings in order to improve the dispersion of power and the brainpower that is brought to bear on a question. Formal voting systems, backed by transparency, provide a powerful mechanism for aggregating knowledge and resolving political conflicts. Particularly in an early-stage liberal democracy, where the art of give and take in political negotiation is only weakly understood, formal voting systems can often mark a big step forward from the autocratic ways.Summing upWe should recognize the scarcity and value of criticism, and create an environment where we disagree without being disagreeable. Every critic is engaged in altruism, and harming her own self-interest, by speaking truth to power. There is a market failure, in the form of an under-supply of criticism owing to positive externalities. It is in the self-interest of the policymaker to engage with critics, so as to improve by discovering areas of weakness in the policy work. When the policymaker is short of time, meeting the critic is more useful than meeting a supporter. Conflict and negotiation is the healthy normal state of a liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is the endless search for a middle road.

> 23Coming out right, always, is too high a barIn most situations, policymakers in India are excessively risk-averse. The phrase ‘policy adventurism’ is a lethal one, which can kill off any proposal. Policymakers would like to cultivate an image of being all-knowing, of occasionally championing an idea, and of coming out right every time. The incentives of officials tend to be asymmetric: success is not particularly important, but failure can be career threatening. There is a particularly harmful combination of low capabilities and low risk taking. When policymakers have poor knowledge, they are less confident. This creates a bias in favour of inaction. The fear of failure feeds into this bias for inaction, or for action in the form of campaigns on Twitter. To solve public policy problems, and build the republic, requires taking actions that involve risk. Real-world policymaking is extremely complicated. If we are very riskaverse, and move only when we are absolutely sure, this will generate excessive conservatism. This was a problem in the past, and this will be a greater issue in the future. In the past, Indian policy reform consisted of low-risk projects like dismantling industrial licensing and dismantling barriers to globalization. The analytical clarity on those issues was strong and there was little that could go wrong. But as these first-order ideas are used up, future policy work will not be as unambiguous. What is normal in the field of public policy is ‘complex systems failure’—where there are many moving parts and they came together in an unexpected way. Failure will happen, and when failure occurs, there is no

> simple concept of identifying the decisive mistake and the key person who made that mistake.Humility in publicWe must necessarily peer into the unknown when we choose between multiple solutions to a visible problem. In most cases, it is not entirely clear what solution is superior. To avoid paralysis, we have to be willing to make mistakes. This requires creating an environment that is more supportive of failure. We need to put aside the machismo, be honest in saying what we know and what we don’t know, and approach every policy initiative as a process of hypothesis testing. If a policymaker lays claim to omniscience and benevolence, this can lead to two outcomes. On one hand, the policymaker can be afflicted by hubris, and suffer from unintended consequences and failure. On the other hand, the policymaker may achieve a genuine understanding of the complexities that are faced, and retreat into paralysis owing to fear of failure that is incompatible with the public claims about omniscience. A key part of this is the allocation of credit. In authoritarian regimes, all achievements belong to the leader, which makes it difficult to ever admit that a mistake was made. When credit is given more accurately, to the cast of thousands that work on any one policy initiative, it is easier for the leadership to accept that things have not worked out well and to introduce course corrections. The best management culture is one in which we get credit for not taking credit. This helps create a healthy environment of trying things, accepting that some did not work, and abandoning or fixing the troubled ones. The mass media sensationalizes success or failure. It puts frail humans on a pedestal, and attributes godlike powers upon them. There is a need for greater maturity on both sides, in the media and in the policy community. Policymakers need to speak clearly about imperfect knowledge, and others

> need to recognize the trial and error that is required of any successful policy process. We start on a journey, and improve things based on criticism and empirical evidence. Bona fide errors are an integral part of any sound policy process. A policymaker who is not making mistakes is not trying hard enough. It is better for the policymaker to honestly depict the lack of knowledge, to speak openly about all policymaking as a research process, and to embrace the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones.A policy process that makes mistakes and learns from themWhen we insist that no mistakes were made, the process of learning stops. Wherever humanly possible, new policy initiatives should first be rolled out on a small experimental basis. This will create experience based on which we can make more rational moves in the future. And, if something does not work too well, we can back away from it without having suffered too high a cost. This is connected to an open and participatory process. If the policymaker claims to know how to cross the river, there is the danger of mistakes or inaction. If, on the other hand, the policymaker only claims to know how to feel the stones, and approaches the larger community with a sense of humility, this gives an environment that is more conducive to taking risks, learning from mistakes, and refining policy strategies based on evidence. The capability of the policy community is a resource, that needs to be nurtured. An approach of acknowledging the uncertainties, and discussing and drawing lessons from failure is the key to obtaining improvements inthe capability of the policy community over time. 1Summing up

> Officials of the Indian government tend to be averse to changing things. This is rooted in the bureaucratic incentives that penalize failure. In order to make faster progress, we need to create an institutional culture that is more accepting of failure. Part of the problem lies in the official line, which does not recognize or discuss failure. But most public policy work is characterized by failure, and we would all be better off by discussing this in a comfortable and realistic way. When a policymaker lays claim to omniscience, it is difficult to admit that a mistake was made. It is better to honestly speak about the uncertainties that are being faced, and embark on policymaking as a process of discovery.

> 24A country is not a companyBefore 1991, most firms in India were managed poorly. We now have a large number of extremely well-run firms in India. The key persons in these firms are legitimately proud of their ability to run large complex organizations. Alongside this, we see the shambolic Indian state, which is unable to get the basics right. Can management skills and techniques carry over from the Indian private sector into government? Unfortunately, the skill and rhythm that is required in the public policy landscape is different from what works in for-profit firms.Government lacks feedback loopsAll big private firms are listed for trading on the stock market and see a stock price. The vast machinery of speculation in financial markets produces a real-time measure of the performance of the firm. Internally, private firms see operational management information system (MIS) statements that are updated daily. Revenue and profit are simple tools to distil the working of the firm down into a numerical yardstick. Are there comparable measures which can be used in public policy? Is GDP growth a good measure of how the government is faring? Later in this book, we show concerns about chasing the yardstick of GDP growth. In any case, in India, we are at the early stages of learning how to measure GDP. Is the performance of Nifty a good measure of how the government is faring? The movements of the stock market index express surprises in the

> outlook for corporate profitability; this is only weakly related to the achievements of the leadership. Is the rupee–dollar exchange rate a good measure of how the government is faring? The fluctuations of the exchange rate have nearly no link with how the country is faring. Depreciation is often beneficial for the economy. When a leadership starts viewing the exchange rate as a measure of its performance, this is generally harmful. There is thus no information system that generates feedback loops for government, in the way that accounting data and stock market data generates feedback loops in private firms.Government agencies are monopoliesThe customers of private firms generally have choices about whom they buy from. State agencies are generally monopolies. The only place that you can get a driver’s licence is a government office; the customer has no choice. The policy thinker Manish Sabharwal once said that RBI’s bond exchange, the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS), ‘has hostages, not customers’. Nobody chooses to be a member of the NDS, they are forced to use it. This diminishes organizational performance. The leadership of a private firm fears financial non-performance, which will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs and empire. Persistent weak performance can induce a sale of the firm to a new shareholder, who can impose painful changes upon the firm. Private firms face the threat of a bankruptcy process where the firm can be shut down or fundamentally reorganized. None of these possibilities influence employees in the government. There are rare events where a government agency is closed down. Politicians fear losing elections. Officials have no fear. The RBI was created in 1934. Consider the thousand-odd large private firms which also existed in 1934. By 2019, most of these firms had gone under, in the face of competitive pressure. The survivors (e.g., Tata Steel)

> were unrecognizably different, in 2019, compared with their organizational capabilities of 1934. But the RBI of 1934 has survived into 2019 without facing any competitive pressure, while having small changes in its organizational capabilities. With private firms, we see something remarkable in the organizational culture of a Tata Steel or an IBM—firms that have managed to stay relevant over very long time periods. In government, in contrast, the oldest agencies are likely to have the most outdated internal arrangements.Government’s coercive power is qualitatively differentIn a private firm, the levers controlled by the management cover products, production processes and the internal organization of the firm. In government, there is similar decision-making power about the internal organization of government. But the surpassing feature of government is the monopolistic power to coerce. The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison.Government has greater complexityA big firm in India has 25,000 employees. Compared with this, state structures are vast. Indian Railways has 1.3 million employees. Even if the efficient staffing at Indian Railways is half this size, it is a vast and complex organization when compared with what we see in the private sector.

> The public policy process plays out not just through employees but through everyone, as coercive steps by the state induce changed behaviour by the people, which feeds back into the working of the state, and so on. This further increases the complexity of decision making. Policy decisions have to take into account the internal behaviour of large complex government organizations, and then the responses of the general public which in India’s case is above a billion people. This is a scale of complexity which is just not found in private firms.Government has to prize rules over dealsIn a private firm, there is ample room for discretion. The idea is to make many tactical decisions— ‘a hustle here and a hustle there’—that add up to profit. As an organization becomes larger and more complex, there is greater use of formal rules. In a ten-man firm, every decision is tactical. By the time we get to a 1000-man firm, there will be an HR policy that will shape and constrain HR actions. If a firm has three franchisees, each of the three contracts can be negotiated separately. But if a firm has a thousand franchisees, there will be a policy framework that determines a few standardized contracts that are applied in all settings. In government, this evolution towards rules is carried forward to an extreme extent. Given the unique features of government, it is pragmatic to work through policy frameworks and not tactical actions. We establish sound general frameworks, and work within them for a long time. We avoid transaction-specific decisions, even when we see a particular situation where the general policy is yielding the wrong answer. In addition, Article 14 of the Constitution of India requires the Indian state to treat identically placed persons identically. There is no such constraint upon private firms. Private firms can make deals, but states need rules.

> Governments must disperse powerThe management of a private firm is often quite autocratic, partly because its internal staff is all that it controls. In contrast, public policy requires dispersion of power. The job description for a role in public policy is a package of policy knowledge, team building and nuanced negotiating ability. These are often elusive for persons with a background of leadership in autocratic firms. Successful governments feature a long and slow process of debate, negotiation and compromise. The leadership in the world of public policy requires the traits of listening, respecting and negotiating middle roads. This is a very different organizational culture when compared with what is found in most private firms. It is interesting to see that the organizational DNA in the largest and most complex firms veers towards the strategies of government. The largest and most complex firms have reduced power of the CEO, dispersed decisionmaking structures, and a greater emphasis on rules rather than discretion. The challenge of public administration lies in carrying this organizational evolution, from small firms to the biggest firms, further up a hundredfold.Governments operate on longer horizonsMany in the world of business have come to revere the alpine-style assault, where a firm builds something very big in almost no time. Instagram got to 10 million users in a year and was bought for $1 billion in two years. A world-straddling company like Google was only founded in 1998. Successful management teams are often imbued with the idea of saving time. The rhythm of public policy is quite different: to do good things requires a long slow ascent. Big sudden phenomena in the world of policy are generally harmful and/or failures.

> 25System thinkingWhen a government gets involved in the working of society at the level of detail, this tends to go wrong. If a government is shaping products and processes, and favouring one technology over another, we are doing something wrong. If a government is ‘picking winners’—one firm over another, one industry over another, one technical standard over anotherwe are doing something wrong. We have to be sceptical about engineers bearing industrial policy. Social engineering works badly as the real world is too complex, intervention is ridden with unanticipated effects and state capacity is limited. The most advanced economies do the least industrial policy. The government should restrict itself to addressing market failure, while being mindful to only pick a few battles given its low capabilities. The economy and society should evolve as a self-organizing system, driven by the innovations of free men and women.Solving coordination problemsThere are, however, some situations in which there is a cautious case for ‘system thinking’ in public policy. System thinking addresses traditional market failures, in the form of asymmetric information, externalities and market power. In fields such as healthcare and pensions, where consumer behaviour may suffer from limited rationality, there is a greater case for system thinking. But it involves a new and daunting level of intrusive intervention, which goes well beyond the main work of public policy.

> Consider a two-way street where people face no restrictions. This will frequently yield traffic jams. When one person drives on one side of the road, this hampers incoming traffic on that side of the road. The adverse impact from one person to another works through channels other than market transactions and voluntary agreements. It is an externality. What is required in addressing the externality is a negotiation between many people, about who will use what parts of the road when, and a tidy solution is surely feasible. But it is difficult for all users of the road to find each other and negotiate such an agreement. It is important to see that there is no complex political economy in this negotiation. Nobody particularly gains or loses from rules of coordination; all we have is a pure Coasean transaction cost of putting people together and negotiating. A ‘Keep left’ rule, imposed by the state and backed by state coercion, nicely solves the problem of coordination by opposing traffic. It is a creative leap, a piece of system thinking, to envision this solution to the coordination problem. Does this smack of central planning? When a government imposes a ‘Keep left’ rule, we can think of this as solving this problem of negotiation. The citizenry has chosen representatives (legislators) who would undertake the negotiation on their behalf, and the outcome of this negotiation is ‘Keep left’.Coercive unbundlingEconomies of scope are about utilizing a customer relationship to sell an adjacent product, and about the reduced cost of producing an adjacent product. When governments use coercive power to prevent a firm from doing adjacent things, they are generally in the wrong. As an example, the Indian financial markets were forcibly cut up into three sub-industries: commodity futures, regulated by the Forward Markets Commission (FMC); equities and long-dated corporate bonds, regulated by
> ^ZJPT2QETaLHYLNIRLp203

> [!note] Page 204
> 
> the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI); and currencies, government bonds and short-dated corporate bonds, regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Firms in each silo were prohibited from doing business in the other two silos. This hampered economies of scale and economies of scope. In general, the coercive power of the state should not be used to hamper firms that exploit economies of scope. In some situations, however, bundling and tying raises concerns about a market failure in the form of market power. As an example, consider the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which has a dominant position in the brand awareness and distribution of insurance products. Suppose a new firm is born, with high skills in the production side of insurance products. This firm would not be able to reach consumers, as LIC has a lock on distribution and sales. LIC can get away with very poor manufacturing, as it owns the distribution. Using state power to force an unbundling, between manufacturing and distribution, can solve this problem. Consider the New Pension System (NPS). Project OASIS, led by Surendra Dave in 1998, saw that the overall pensions problem contained three distinct industries : managing money,owning customers, and record-keeping. 1 It suggested an unbundledarchitecture where pension fund management was separated from interaction with customers. Record-keeping was centralized at an information utility, to harness economies of scale, and to ensure that it was easy for consumers to switch from one pension fund manager to another. This design caters to heightened competition. On the strength of better fund management, a new pension fund manager can steal away customers, as switching is always possible. Similarly, the front-end firms would live or die based on their friendliness to customers, and not on the quality of their fund management. In the conventional world, finance professionals generally focus on the deal making required to get a new product to the customer. These finance professionals are a little shocked when, in the NPS environment, incumbent manufacturers do not control the distribution. All distributors are equally

> keen to push all products; all manufacturers have equal access to all distributors. Similar arguments are found in electricity where governments have pushed in favour of breaking up monolithic electricity utilities into three distinct industries: generation, transmission and distribution. This creates opportunities for entrants in generation and transmission. Until this unbundling was done, the firm that owned the distribution was the only game in town when it came to transmission and generation. Forcible unbundling backed by state coercion is a harsh intervention. What is an alternative, softer strategy? Suppose a new-generation company came up, and was denied access by an old-style integrated electricity utility. It could have used conventional competition law to litigate, and could have won, on the surface. However, there are too many levers, through which the monolithic utility could have rigged the game to disfavour the new entrant. It would take very high state capacity for a Competition Commission of India (CCI) to track down such misbehaviour and enforce against it. When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured. A simple unbundling rule is easier to articulate and enforce, when compared with the complexity of fighting with an integrated utility that is trying to hamper access to a new entrant. In the field of technology policy, at heart, net neutrality regulation is about forcing an unbundling between the content industry and the data pipes. The content industry is analogous to a manufacturer. What is best for society is that content firms slug it out against each other to produce better content. Under net neutrality, content firms are not allowed to do deals with the data pipes in order to create privileged distribution for themselves. Similarly, data pipe companies must slug it out against each other to give us fatter pipes at lower prices. But they are not allowed to do deals with content companies in order to create complicated bundles of content and pipes for customers. The separation protects competition in both industries. A firm that invents a new biscuit puts 10 per cent of its effort into the biscuit and 90 per cent of its effort into figuring out the distribution. Incumbents always have deep pockets, are entrenched in the distribution,

> and try to choke off competitors there. Every practitioner living in this world treats these anti-competitive barriers as an everyday reality. The Internet is a unique open market; the moment a new shopfront comes up, it is instantly connected to all customers who are on the Internet. This implies superior competitive conditions when compared with the old economy. A new e-commerce firm puts 100 per cent of its effort into innovation, as it knows that all pipes are of equal access. Net neutrality regulation is aboutkeeping it this way. 2These examples are related to the common law concept of a ‘common carrier’, which is a firm that transports (say) goods in a non-discriminatory manner. The state coerces common carriers to force them to treat all customers equally.The need for caution in system thinkingSystem thinking is very attractive to engineers. Every engineer feels she can redesign society in certain ways that are good for everyone. But system thinking is fraught with danger. It is important to underline the use of state power, of the monopoly of violence that the state possesses, when policymakers do system thinking. When a government imposes a ‘Keep left’ rule, this is done by putting policemen in the street who impose punishments upon persons who drive on the right-hand side. System design in public policy is unlike engineering design done in a private firm. A private firm that designs a product tries to put it on the market, and if there is a lack of voluntary buyers, the firm loses money, realizes this was not a good design, and goes back into debating the next design. In contrast, when system design is done in public policy, the citizenry has no choice, the solution is forced upon them backed by threats of violence, and there is a limited chance of discovering that the design was a mistake.

> In the optimistic view, the engineer in the government is omniscient and cares about the welfare of the people. In the real world, both these assumptions are questionable. It is very difficult to think about design questions on the scale of society. Human systems reflect the interactions of a large number of sentient persons, and attempts at intervention are plagued by the law of unintended consequences. We may emphasize that social systems involve the interactions of many people, and envisioning these complexities requires knowledge of the social sciences and humanities, and not just engineering. Hence, the policymaker can easily be wrong. In addition, public choice theory reminds us that policymakers are just people, and are likely to pursue their own personal objectives, which may or may not align with welfare of the public. For these reasons, it is useful to approach system thinking with high scepticism, and use the coercive power of the state in reshaping society only rarely. For most situations, the self-organizing system that is the market economy works better. This reflects a trade-off between the cost of some situations where system design in public policy goes wrong versus the cost of some situation where the self-organizing system gets trapped in the wrong equilibrium. The self-organizing system works better than state-led design of society when state capacity is high. It is even more attractive when state capacity is low. When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance that state power will be used to impose the wrong designs upon society. There is a greater chance of this power being hijacked to serve an agenda other than public welfare. Hence, while mature market economies avoid system thinking, we in India should avoid it even more.How to do system thinking

> If system thinking must be done in the public policy process, how should it be organized? The first threat is that of the designers within government having the wrong design. To avoid this problem, a strong policy pipeline is required, with evidence, debate and the development of consensus in the expert community. If a design is made by any small group of people, without ample debate over elongated periods of time across a broad expert community, there is a greater risk of being wrong. As an example, in the international engineering community, many important technical standards have been developed by the ‘Internet Engineering Task Force’ (IETF). This is an open process through which rival firms, academics and enthusiasts are able to debate and develop standards. Such a process has a better chance of avoiding errors and of achieving democratic legitimacy. The second problem to address is the views of affected persons. A design that appears attractive to its creators might impose tremendous difficulties upon the economy. Broad-based consultation is required, with a large number of affected persons, in order to hear diverse views. Social systems are complex, and a design that appears clean to an engineer might induce unpleasant unintentional consequences for some individuals in society. As with all government intervention, it is important to clearly state the problem that is sought to be solved, define what constitutes success, and set up a measurement system to watch how the economy is responding to the initiative. It is important to be humble, to recognize when things have not gone as planned, and be ready to change course. A thumb rule that we would advocate runs as follows: Each policy thinker should permit herself a budget constraint of supporting no more than one policy proposal, that involves system thinking, in her life.Summing up

> Industrial policy works badly. Government should not pick winners. The purpose of government is to address market failure. A government should not be making decisions on which firm is better, what technology is better, or what technical standard is better. There are some situations where addressing market failure (asymmetric information, externalities and market power) can be done by using the coercive power of the state to design society. A ‘keep left’ rule, imposed by the government, brings order to traffic; it puts an end to the negative externalities of roads without such a rule. This can be rationalized as legislators engaging in a Coasean negotiation, and agreeing upon a contract that solves the problem of externalities. When a government engages in system thinking, and uses the coercive power of the state in order to impose a design upon society, there are many ways in which this can go wrong. In public policy settings, coercion is applied and there is no feedback loop through which the design is rejected by customers or improved in response to customer feedback. Social systems are very complex and there is a high risk of unintended consequences. Social engineering is thus difficult to do. The engineer may pursue objectives that diverge from the welfare of the public. The selforganizing system of the market economy generally evolves towards better solutions on its own. There are some rare situations when a certain touch of system design is useful. One of them is a forced unbundling between industries which improves competition. Net neutrality is the use of the coercive power of the state to force a separation between two industries: the content industry and the carriage industry. Firms that make data pipes only compete on how well their pipes work, and all content providers are able to carry their product on all pipes. Such non-discriminatory treatment by the pipes is related to the ‘common carrier’ principle in common law. System thinking is more important in contexts like health and pensions, where we are at the limits of the rational decision-making of the typical individual. If system thinking must be done, there are some good hygiene principles that are required. The development of the design must be done through an

> open process. The development of Internet protocols, through the IETF, is a role model for such an open process. Engineers may often tend to ignore the views of affected persons. Humanities and social science knowledge is of essence in thinking about questions from the viewpoint of the individual. Social engineering is fraught with danger. As a thumb rule, we suggest that each policy person should have a budget constraint of supporting one policy proposal, involving system thinking, in one life.

> 26Beware the rule of officialsDuring World War II, the British rulers established extreme restrictions upon the Indian economy. After Independence, these evolved into a central planning system. From the late 1980s onward, this has morphed into an ‘administrative state’, the rule by officials who have fine-grained control over the decisions of private persons, with functions that veer into legislative and judicial roles. This involves excessive interference in the lives of private persons. However, for the major part, this is the structure of the Indian state, and to do public policy in India is to operate within the contours of this administrative state. Our first-order concern in Indian public policy is to improve state capability within this setting. It is useful, however, to re-examine the administrative state from first principles.The traditional case for strong contract enforcementLet us start at the objective of contract enforcement by courts. This is generally seen as being the foundation of business. Firms cannot contract with firms, and governments cannot contract with firms, if contracts are not honoured. Through this, an efficient and independent judiciary is an essential foundation of the market economy. Economists have, however, been relatively lukewarm about the importance of this contract enforcement. How does poor contract enforcement matter?
> ^8SBLIBIKaLHYLNIRLp211

> [!note] Page 212
> 
> Under conditions of weak contract enforcement, people would limit their contracting to friends and family. Repeated games would spring up, where good behaviour is optimal. There would be an efficiency loss, because markets would become less competitive. A new player would not be able to dislodge friends and family from one’s contracts. When contract enforcement is weak, firms would specialize less, there would be greater internal production and reduced use of contracting. This would adversely impact upon transactions and thus productivity.These effects are present, but they are not particularly large. In this first cut of the analysis, the adverse impact of poor contract enforcement is relatively limited. The role of the judiciary, however, runs much deeper: it impacts upon the very requirement for an administrative state in addressing market failures.Private solutions that solve market failureWhen person A inflicts a negative externality upon person B, this is termed a ‘tort’ in common law. Under common law, person B is able to go to court and ask to be compensated for harm. Many negative externalities can be handled through this mechanism. If person A faces the credible threat that person B can win damages, this will constrain person A’s behaviour. This would remove the need for a state apparatus to coerce person A in ways that do not harm person B. All that is required is the common law of torts, and courts that enforce this law. This pathway addresses a large part of the market failure associated with negative externalities and asymmetric information. This pathway breaks down when the courts do not work. What about the problem where the persons adversely affected are many? A factory may emit pollution which may harm many individuals, none of whom have adequate incentive to undertake the expenditure of litigation.

> through which a group of people are organized to demand damages. This pathway breaks down when the courts do not work or when class action lawsuits are infeasible. This vision of enforcement relies on the aggrieved person taking recourse to courts. It involves private enforcement of law. As an example, if a person or a group of persons were adversely affected by securities fraud, they would gather evidence and sue. In this book, we have emphasized the power of private negotiation, as envisioned by Ronald Coase, for arriving at private solutions to many externality problems. These private solutions can flourish when, and only when, the courts are swift and competent. Otherwise, these contracts are not enforceable and the Coasean approach to addressing certain market failure is infeasible. In this perspective, a great deal of market failure can be addressed through contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. Looking back into Indian history, this pathway was ruled out when, after Independence, there were difficulties in judiciary.Example 31: SEBI’s monopoly on enforcing securities lawConsider the establishment of SEBI, during 1988–92. In the early drafting of the SEBI Act, it was felt that if private persons could sue, on the grounds of violation of securities law, there was a greater risk of harassment. Therefore, the SEBI Act, unlike the US Securities Act, prohibits private persons from suing for violations of securities law. Only SEBI has the right to initiate such actions. Victims of securities law violations do not have this right. Alongside this, India lacks a class action lawsuit mechanism, so there is no mechanism for (say) the shareholders of Satyam to sue. The design that was adopted in building SEBI was that only SEBI can initiate enforcement actions against a person. This is how we got to the administrative state. Now the difficulties of public management impact upon the enforcement

> process. Thus, persons who have experienced harm are supplicants before SEBI, requesting SEBI to enforce securities law. Consider the judicial wing associated with regulatory actions. Securities regulators in other countries fuse the legislative and executive functions. They write regulations and they conduct investigations. But the cases brought by the securities regulator are heard in an ordinary court. In India, given the delays in judicial enforcement, we placed a judicial function at SEBI also. With this, the doctrine of separation of powers is absent in a regulator like SEBI. SEBI has become a very powerful organization, by the fusing of legislative, executive and judicial functions, and having a monopoly on enforcing securities law. In the memorable phrase of M. Sahoo, now chairman of the IBBI, regulators in India are ‘mini-states’. This concentration of powers hampers the emergence of state capacity.The policy possibilities for a country with high judicial capacityIndia today is at a polar extreme, away from mature common law jurisdictions, with the domination of the administrative state. We are weak on contract enforcement, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. Organizations like SEBI are increasingly stepping into the shoes of the erstwhile central planning system. In the late 1980s and the 1990s, the leadership in the Ministry of Finance and in SEBI was engaged in building SEBI in a practical way. They treated courts as flawed and looked for ways to make progress. While such strategies are useful in the short run, at a deeper level, they have limitations. When power is concentrated at organizations like SEBI, these organizations will find it difficult to achieve state capacity. The detailed interference by the administrative state in the economy saps economic vitality. There is a need to rethink this construction of the administrative state, in order to set

> India on a path of sustained economic growth into becoming a mature market economy. The detailed licence–permit raj, and the fear of investigation agencies, are arguably at a peak in India today. How do we restore freedom? The agenda of liberalization and economic freedom requires going back to the foundations of common law: to a world of contracts, torts, private enforcement and class action lawsuits. This is what is required to scale back the administrative state. The traditional conception of economists on contract enforcement has been that courts are required to enforce contracts. When the courts fail in this, the implications are relatively modest: there is reduced specialization and there are repeated games. Our perspective, however, runs deeper. When the courts fail, we get the rule of officials. After Independence, we fared poorly on development of the judiciary. The coping mechanisms adopted by policymakers, in response to the failure of the judiciary, have their own harmful consequences. We need to address these failures at the root cause, through fundamental change in the judicial branch. We need to push back on the new central planning system, this administrative state, and graduate to a world of much greater reliance on the judiciary, a world of contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement.Summing upThe ‘administrative state’ is the rule of bureaucrats. This is a state where the officials manning the executive creep into controlling legislative and judicial functions. In the administrative state, politics—the process of negotiation between interest groups—has a limited role. The Indian approach to central planning of the economy, where officials have considerable control over the life of private persons, is uncomfortably close to the administrative state.

> Economists have emphasized the role of the judiciary in contract enforcement, which enables the market economy. While contract enforcement is important, the more important role for judicial capacity lies in private solutions to market failure. Negative externalities can be solved through the law of torts, as long as litigation is efficacious. Many classic problems of asymmetric information, where we do consumer protection, can be addressed through torts. When many people are adversely affected in a problem like pollution from a factory, the collective action problem can be solved through class action suits. When private people are able to sue, and state agencies do not have a monopoly on enforcing laws, this reduces the reliance on state agencies for enforcing laws. The agenda of economic freedom in India is ultimately about scaling back the administrative state. This journey runs through great improvements in the courts.

> 27Policymaking is siege-style assaultIn mountaineering, the climbers choose from two strategies. In the siegestyle assault, a large team establishes a base camp, which sets up the second camp and establishes the logistics for resupplying it, and so on. In the case of Mount Everest, there is a base camp at 5400 metres, camp 1 at 6100 metres, camp 2 at 6400 metres, camp 3 at 6800 metres and camp 4 at 8000 metres. Finally, from here, a few climbers try to get up to the top, which is at an altitude of 8848 metres. The siege-style assault is slow, expensive and reliable. In an alpine-style assault, on the other hand, there is none of this preparation. One or two people try to walk up at the fastest possible pace. When the alpine-style assault works, the result is always remarkable. But it requires superhuman capabilities, and the probability of failure is high. We think that the public policy process requires a siege-style assault. Every now and then, there are situations where an alpine-style assault yields some dramatic gains, but in time, these gains tend to be impermanent.Example 32: The UK policy process on in vitro fertilization (IVF)The world’s first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in the UK on 25 July 1978. There was a great deal of hostility to the concept of a test-tube baby at the time. In 1982, the UK government established a committee headed by the moral philosopher Mary Warnock, to think about the associated public policy problems. The Warnock report was delivered in 1984 and led up to the ‘Human Fertilization and Embryology Act’ of 1990. This Act created

> the ‘Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority’ (HFEA) to adjudicate and license all work on human embryos, whether for IVF or for scientificstudy. 1How might things have worked out in the Indian policy process? We can see a few potential pitfalls:Right in 1978, when there was public criticism, there is a likelihood of a simple ban coming about. There is a bias, in India, for muscular responses to current newspaper stories. Letting the field unfold under laissez faire for four years is an unlikely event in the Indian policy process. As the securities expert Ashish Chauhan pleads, ‘First you have to have a market, and only then you can regulate it.’ If a committee had to be created, it would have been hard to find a moral philosopher to head it, as the humanities have atrophied in Indian universities. The translation of the report into the Act would have been done badly. The translation of the law into state capacity at HFEA would have been done badly.This example encourages us to see the full pipeline of the policy process, and work on strengthening all elements of it.The policy pipelineStage 1 of the policy pipeline is the establishment of the statistical system. Facts need to be systematically captured. Without facts, the entire downstream process breaks down. Our only hope for truth to matter is for truth to be recorded and widely disseminated. In the modern world, few actors in the economy have an incentive to do a good job of measurement. As an example, academic economists are quite comfortable doing research with faulty data, because the academic

> 
> economists who will review their work do not ask questions about data quality. Stage 2 of the policy pipeline is descriptive and causal research. This requires a research community which will study the data, establish broad facts and regularities, and explore causal connections. This work should be primarily grounded in the Indian locale. Academic researchers are too often swayed by the curiosity of journal editors and referees in a different continent. This hampers the choice of questions to pursue and the quality of research design through which those questions are sought to be answered. Stage 3 of the policy pipeline is the creative phase of inventing and proposing new policy solutions. A large menu of choices needs to be at hand, for possible policy pathways. The republic is always short-changed when ‘there is no alternative’ (TINA) to one mainstream idea. At present in India, there is no community which systematically looks for fully articulated solutions. Academic journals do not publish policy proposals, hence academic researchers are not keen to invent policy proposals. Stage 4 of the policy pipeline is the public debate where rival solutions compete with each other. This requires a vigorous process of debate and discussion, in writing and in seminars. A broad consensus needs to come about on what will work, within the analytical community. In the Indian context, this is often assisted by the expert committee process. The purpose of the expert committee process is to sift through an array of possible policy pathways that are in the fray at the end of stage 3, and filter down to a few which make sense. The best expert committee reports help mainstream novel ideas in policy reform, and pull together the state of the art into a report. As Isher Ahluwalia says, nothing gets done by writing it in a government committee report, but nothing ever got done without it being repeatedly written into multiple government committee reports. Stage 5 of the policy pipeline is the internal government process of decision making. This is where ministers and senior bureaucrats take stock

> of the range of possible policy pathways and make decisions. This is the zone of political economy, and the creative trade-offs that make progress possible. Stage 6 of the policy pipeline is the translation of the decisions into legal instruments. Most policy decisions must be implemented through law that is enacted by the legislature, or subordinate legislation in the form of rules or regulations. High technical quality, and subtle detail, of this drafting process is of great importance. In India, all too often, the drafting of law is done by persons who have a superficial understanding of the prior stages of the policy pipeline, which leads to poor drafting of law. Finally, stage 7 of the policy pipeline is the construction of state capacity, in the form of administrative structures that enforce the law. Looking back into our history, the successful reforms in India were those that fared well on all seven elements of the policy pipeline. This, in turn, required capacity building in all the stages. It is only when there were human capabilities on all seven stages of the pipeline, and enough time had been given for working through these stages, that we got a sound reform.An alternative depiction of the policy processThe economist Satya Poddar has a different conception of the policy process, which is also illuminating. He thinks in terms of a four-part story:1. Defining the future state, or the preferred policy outcome, 2. Preparing a blueprint for the design and specification of the future state, 3. Defining the transition path from the current to the future state, and 4. Building political consensus or garnering public support for the change.

> These elements are intertwined and are rarely sequential phases in the implementation process. Yet, they serve as a useful framework for project management. The four parts require different skill sets. For example, we need visionaries and saints for the first element, who can rise above the morass of information, scientific knowledge and cacophony of self-interests. Preparation of the blueprint is science, engineering and public administration. A poorly designed transition path is often the main cause of policy failures, and thinking through a sound transition is more art than science. Consensus building is predominantly an art.The opportunity in crisisIt’s a mistake to believe that the change that has not yet come will never come. On 9/11 the world changed; on 10/26 the PATRIOT Act was passed. The Patriot Act was not written in 46 days. It was simply the instrument that was ready when the moment arrived. ‘Persuasive Language for Language Security: Making the case for software safety’, conference talk by Mike Walker, 24 May 2018The US politician, Rahm Emanuel, famously commented that ‘a crisis is a terrible thing to waste’. Crises are important events where the ‘Overton window’ is enlarged, and there is a larger zone of possibility in stage 5 of the policy pipeline. Policymakers should be alert to these opportunities. More generally, there is a lot to be said for a policy process where a community chips away at stages 1 through 4 of the pipeline, and waits for the right moment when stage 5 will use the ideas and stages 6 and 7 will use the human capabilities. The relationship between crises and reforms is, however, highly exaggerated. There are three contrary points of view that have to be kept in mind. First, the possibilities in a crisis are the product of previous work that has been done in the early stages of the pipeline, and the human capabilities for stages 5, 6 and 7 that have been built ahead of time. The apparently high
> ^AGETTSDJaLHYLNIRLp223

> [!note] Page 224
> 
> marginal product of crisis is partly grounded in misattribution; a lot of the credit has to go to the investments by the policy community of previous years. When we see the correlation between crisis and reforms, we are exaggerating the role of the runner who carries the baton across the finish line. Investments in the early stages of the policy pipeline, and in human capacity, have to be in place. Otherwise, a crisis will be wasted. As an example, the rape in Delhi on 16 December 2012 created a political moment for reform of the criminal justice system. However, as the early stages of the pipeline had not been constructed ahead of time, and human capabilities for stages 5, 6 and 7 were weak, the response that was obtained in that terrible moment was weak. The second concern that has to be kept in mind is that when the range of possibilities is enlarged, this includes some very harmful ideas. We should not think that the leadership is always benign and intelligent. Crises are dangerous moments when placed in a fragile liberal democracy like India. Authoritarian rulers chafe against the checks and balances of a free press, the legislature, the courts and independent statistics. Democratic politics is about the hard work of negotiation, and when it works, heads of state routinely experience defeat. Authoritarian leaders find this a frustrating process; in fact they are often inexperienced in the culture of democratic law-making. They lack the temperament of sharing power, and are uncomfortable with the traditions of criticism and compromise. Crises offer aspiring authoritarians an escape from constitutional shackles. When security threats arise, it is easy to label all critics as antinational. When national security is at risk, the press, the courts and opposition parties are more deferential. We have numerous examples of crises that gave damaging outcomes. Hitler exploited the Reichstag fire in 1933. In Peru, an insurgency and economic crisis gave Fujimori the opportunity to dissolve the Constitution in 1992. Erdogan imprisoned thousands of opponents and intellectuals after a failed coup attempt in 2016. Indira Gandhi used the economic and political crisis of 1976 to declare Emergency.

> The confusion, anxiety, and the profound sense of bewilderment about market forces are inevitable when breadwinners must worry whether income will be enough next week to feed the family . . . You cannot think straight in the midst of hyperinflation. The society becomes unglued.Jeffrey SachsLet us shift gears away from a fundamental threat to the republic, in a crisis. When there is low state capacity, the day-to-day firefighting in a crisis can yield poor results. For example, India repeatedly had inflation crises in the past decades, and each inflation crisis triggered off a fresh batch of harmful command-and-control measures. The reform which actually matteredinflation targeting through the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) of 20 February 2015—was not triggered off by an immediate inflation crisis. Similarly, RBI produced seventy-four regulations in the first fifty days after the demonetization of 2016, and these crisis-management actions were not RBI’s finest hour. The 2013 currency crisis had sustained policy activism over a period of months, with many adverse effects upon theeconomy. 2 Given weak institutions in India, we should dread a crisis.The third concern is that focusing on opportunities for reform in a crisis tends to understate the value and possibilities from incremental reform. A lot more is possible from the slow process of improving things every day, than is commonly given credit for. The UK got to liberal democracy without anything like a French Revolution. We should not be entranced by dramatic wins; we should have the endurance to engage in ‘the slow boring of hard boards’ over long decades. In India, it is often argued that deeper reform will only come about in a crisis. A flip side of this belief is a demoralized view that under normal circumstances, policy reforms are infeasible. We see the policy process as a process of building knowledge and conducting hypothesis tests every day, and we dread a crisis.Example 33: The reforms of 1991

> The reforms of 1991 are linked, in the minds of many, to the balance of payments crisis and consequential IMF conditionality. A closer examination of that period, however, shows the policy pipeline that was established through the 1980s and made this possible. The decades in which India grew at 3.5 per cent, while East Asia did much better, had made an enormous impression upon the policy community. The intellectual foundations of the 1991 reforms were laid by Jagdish Bhagwati, Padma Desai, T.N. Srinivasan, Arun Shourie, Manmohan Singh, Anne Krueger, Ashok Desai, Montek Ahluwalia, and the other pioneers of market-oriented policy thinking in India. The government committee process had established key pillars forreform, including the Dagli Committee on controls and subsidies (1979), 3the P.C. Alexander Committee on import-export policies and procedures (1977), the Abid Hussain Committee on trade policy (1984), and the G.S. Patel Committee on stock market reform (1984). By the late 1980s, there was a community of key persons in a dozen ministries who were envisioning a market-oriented India. There was an entire community that was ready to play a leadership role in economic reforms. Indeed, it was the ideas of this community which were written into the IMF conditionalities of 1991. If these elements of the policy pipeline had not been in place, ahead of time, the crisis of 1991—on its own—would not have induced the positive changes that it did. For a contrast, Pakistan has had twenty-one loans from the IMF from 1958 to 2019, but lacked the policy community and the early stages of the pipeline, through which these moments of crises could be turned into accomplishments for policymakers.Assessing the state of maturity of the reforms process in a field

> For people who take interest in a field in India—e.g., agricultural reformit is useful to score the state of maturity at each of the seven stages, every year. At each link in the chain, we should ask: What is the state of knowledge, literature and community? Can we identify ten highly capable persons (of all ideological persuasions) in each stage of the pipeline? A field is in poor shape on stages 1, 2 and 3 if we are not able to envision ten wise persons who can usefully be members of an important expert committee (at stage 4). This classification system can be used to systematically identify the weak links in the chain in a field of interest, and strengthen those.Capacity building for the Indian policy processThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. Chinese proverbCapacity building for Indian policy reform requires fostering capabilities in all seven stages. Successful reforms tend to take place when there is maturity in all the seven areas. Activities that do not fit in the pipeline have limited usefulness. Alpine-style assaults are a high-risk strategy; they will often fail or be reversed. The pipeline flows from left to right, and therefore there are prerequisites. The early stages have to be complete for the late stages to fare well. A systematic strategy of identifying the gaps—e.g., ‘in field X, there is a particularly important weakness at stage 3’—can lead to constructive strategies to address these gaps. The seven elements help us think about areas that are ripe for reform versus those that are not. The first four stages of the pipeline are of particular interest. When these early stages are strong, there is a possibility of making significant progress in actually doing reforms. The leadership which finds itself in such a situation should thank the people who put in the requisite investments, in previous years, to build the early stages.

> [!note] Page 228
> 
> When these early stages are weak, there is little opportunity to achieve significant reforms. It is quite inexpensive, to nurture these stages of the pipeline, and create reform opportunities for the future. But when a leadership is short-sighted and skimps on this nurturing, this has harmful effects in ways that are not visible at the time.Summing upProgress in policy involves a pipeline that runs from data to research to multiple policy proposals to public debate about rival proposals to decisions to legal instruments to implementation. If we use the key ‘|’ to denote a pipe then the policy pipeline is data | research | proposals | debate | decisions | legal instruments | implementation. This is a slow, siege-style assault. There is a widespread beliefs that crises are an ideal opportunity for reforms. However, crises are difficult times. If the pipeline is not mature, ahead of time, in the heat of the crisis it is not possible to overcome the gaps in knowledge and human capacity. When crises enlarge the range of possibilities, this includes some harmful ideas. Checks and balances are less effective in a crisis. Things can more easily go wrong.

For a given field (e.g., property rights), it is useful to formally assess the state of capability in each stage of the policy pipeline. Each stage requires mature knowledge and a strong community. This will help guide the most valuable subsequent actions that need to be undertaken to obtain reform in a field.

A funding organization is very different from a regulating organization, which, in turn, is very different from a producing organization.

> Sequencing discussions in India often degenerate into choosing low hanging fruit to begin the work, and proclaiming that an important reform has begun. Sophisticated thinking on sequencing involves five elements:1. Capacity building in the policy process: We have shown seven elements of the policy pipeline. There is a natural sequencing, going from left to right, of the order in which actions should be undertaken. 2. Prerequisites: When x is a prerequisite for y, we have to get x in place before y. 3. Learning by doing: Start with simple problems, learn public management, and gradually escalate complexity. 4. Political economy considerations: Weigh the gains and the costs imposed by various alternative components, and take the ones with high economic gain but low political cost first. Early moves should create a constituency for the late moves. Early moves should not walk into a political economy trap. 5. Stinginess: Start on a low scale on coercive power and spending, escalate only when capabilities are proven.

> The policymaker has to do many things. In what order should they be done? Too often, in India, policymakers pick one of two easy things, ‘the lowhanging fruit’, and after that the reform peters out. Doing the easiest thing first is generally not the optimal sequencing. The policy pipeline shapes sequencing. If the data is lacking, it will not be possible to make progress on policy design. Therefore, when the data is lacking, the first thing in the sequencing should be improvements in the data. In the working of real-world systems, there are prerequisites. An inflation-targeting central bank will require a capable bond market, in order to do the monetary policy transmission. Reforms of electricity generation will not work if the electricity distribution does not work. We have to identify these choke points and solve them first. State capacity does not come about easily. It is better to solve easy problems first, that put us on the path to higher state capacity in the future. Capability emerges out of the process of learning-by-doing. This calls for low transaction-intensity, less discretion, low stakes and less secrecy, at the early stages. It is important to think through the political economy. This is not just about buying out the persons who lose from a reform. The early steps should create gainers who will then support and sustain the reform. In the early stages of building the republic, low coercive power should be given to government organizations, particularly the powers to raid, investigate and punish. Through this, we reduce the stakes. Only after high success is achieved, in wielding low coercive power, can there be a discussion about whether higher coercive power is desirable.

> If we were in Sweden, we would do normal public economics: We would identify market failure and address it. If we live in a country with low state capacity, how does this change our thinking? In the international experience, waging war was an important pathway to developing state capacity. That pathway is not open to India, given the nuclear deterrent. When there is low state capacity, there is a bigger chance of state power being used in wrong ways. Therefore, it is wise to use coercion mildly. When state capacity is low, tax rates should be low, expenditures on public programmes should be low, the investigative powers of the agencies should be low and the punishments that are encoded into laws should be low. When state capacity is low, we should design simple interventions that are easy to implement. A single-rate GST makes lower demands of state capacity, in the annual process of making the budget and in the everyday process of tax administration. The weak state has highly limited resources of money, of the time of capable staff, and the management time of the leadership. Rather than spread this widely, it makes more sense, under conditions of low state capacity, to attempt doing fewer things. How to choose these fewer things? One useful test is whether there is a market failure. Many things should not be done, as they do not address market failure. The core of any state is four elements: the criminal justice system, the judiciary, tax collection and financial regulation. Without these, there can be no economy. Hence, these four areas should be the limited areas of focus. We should learn how to run a state by building capability in these four areas.

Vague, multiple or conflicting objectives cater to corruption and incompetence. 2. Formal processes for legislative functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency wields the power to write law. 3. Formal processes for executive functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency performs executive functions like licensing and investigation. This is analogous to the role of the Criminal Procedure Code in binding the police to how they function. 4. Formal processes for judicial functions: The law must write the due process through which the judicial functions are performed. There must be a hearing, the person conducting the proceedings must be unconflicted, orders and penalties must be reasoned, and an efficacious appeal must be possible. 5. Reporting and accountability: The agency must release enough information about its own functioning so as to be held accountable for its use of public resources and wielding the coercive power of the state. 6. Board: The law must write the role and structure of the board. The board must have a majority of non-government members, who must hold the management accountable; and the board must control the design of the organization.

Recruiting famous people or skilled people will not change the organization design. Building state capacity will not come out of hiring Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or non-IAS or private people. Government works better when there is dispersion of power. A great deal of failure comes from a few individuals controlling excessive power. Checks and balances are key. The drafting of law involves two key elements.

Government departments in India are overloaded with many tasks and it is hard to reform this. ‘Agencification’ will help. Establish an organization outside the department, give it a clear objective, and hold it accountable. Departments must contract out, to such agencies, all technical functions which can be contracted out through well-specified laws. Once this process is complete, the work inside the department will consist of (a) participating in the governance of the external agencies, and solving the principal–agent problem between department and agency, and (b) all the unexpected things and political problems, which could not be contracted out. ‘Agencification’ will work better when there is a great focus upon rule of law, separation of powers, and low coercion. Agencies must have low powers of investigation, punishment, spending, etc. Only after an agency is proven as having high levels of state capacity can a slow process of giving more power be evaluated.

> state capacity. The law that sets up an agency must have clarity of purpose, formal processes for legislative-executive-judicial functions, reporting and accountability, and correct design of the composition and functions of the board. About 140 sections of law, which set up this machinery, is found in the draft Indian Financial Code, version 1.1. Agencies can sometimes collapse into everyday practical activities, and a loss of strategic thinking. Functionaries would show up to work every day and do the same work that they did the previous day. The board and the top management of the agency have to provide leadership. This involves a feedback loop of taking in information, developing a situational awareness, and undertaking actions that deliver the mandate of the agency. This is related to the teeth-to-tail ratio problem: if an agency is only paying salaries of front-line field operatives, it is all teeth and no tail, it has lost the ability to think.

> Discretionary power is routinely abused in the Indian state. The answer is not to remove all discretion. If there is no ability to see the world, and choose the right response, there can be no state capacity. The answer lies in establishing formal procedures with the rule of law, so that discretion is contained in checks and balances. Administrative law is thus at the heart of the Indian journey. Building a bridge requires money and time. From the decision to build the bridge to the inauguration, it takes a long time. In similar fashion, building an agency requires money and time. Merely hiring a few people and renting an office do not give a working agency. When a fledgling agency is asked to do work, this is premature load bearing and it generates an organizational collapse. When reforms have to be brought to existing agencies, the incumbent officials resent reductions in their arbitrary power. They argue that if a policeman has to go to a judge and get a warrant before entering a home, we will fail to catch criminals. But it is only in a police state that a policeman’s job is easy.

We must take great interest in the methods and administrative difficulties, of each data source, before deciding to use it. There are many coping mechanisms. Policy design can plan to discover prices through auctions, rather than assume that adequate information is available up front. There is a greater role for qualitative research, given the weaknesses of quantitative research. Every policymaker must kick off long-range improvements in measurement. The most valuable thing, for the Indian policy process, is sustained measurement, and not one-off measurement. When a phenomenon is measured, again and again, we develop the long-term time series, and the observation of many units and many geographical locations. These are the most useful data sets of the country. Government needs to release much more information in the public domain, particularly record-level anonymized micro data. What can be obtained through the RTI Act should be published. Data that is made using public money should always be released to the public.

Sustained work by large numbers of intellectuals in knowledge institutions is essential to achieving the new level of thinking. Every policymaker will benefit by setting up a few knowledge partnership contracts, and take effort to make them work. In the short term, they are low-cost initiatives. In the long run, these will yield a qualitatively superior trajectory of the policy process. This approach needs to be applied in all parts of government. Whether it is in Karnataka or in Shimoga, policymakers require capable knowledge institutions, which are steeped in the local context, and develop metis. The intelligentsia in public policy is derived from the broad foundations of the humanities and social science knowledge that is made in the universities. In India, public investments in the universities have emphasized science and engineering and neglected the humanities and social sciences. Building the republic requires capabilities in the universities—in the humanities and the social sciences.

> 34Building the perfect GST in a low-capacity stateMany of the themes of this book come together in the GST reform. What is the best path to the GST? From the viewpoint of state capacity, it makes sense to start with a low single rate. This is the easiest GST to implement, as it is administratively simple and the incentives for evasion are lowest. To make this concrete, consider the possibility of a single flat rate of 10 per cent GST with a comprehensive base. This draws on the global wisdom that the right way to do a GST is to have a single rate. A single 10 per cent rate applied on 70 per cent of the economy yields 7 per cent of GDP as tax revenue, and even if we actually obtain a part of this, we are broadly okay. At this low rate, it would have been possible to avoid all exclusions. Petroleum products could have gone in, real estate could have gone in. To many of us in India, a single rate appears sharply different from the present arrangements. It is always possible to layer non-VATable sin taxes on top of the basic GST, which would serve as Pigouvian taxes. Individual state governments can choose how they wish to think about alcohol taxation. A carbon tax can potentially be layered on top of the GST. A state like Sikkim, which prizes environmental protection, may impose a sin tax on plastic consumption. We should decouple our thinking between two distinct problems: a single-rate GST and a collection of non-VATable sin taxes. The distortion associated with a tax rate goes up in proportion to the rate squared. Hence, the low value (10 per cent) would have gone with a reduced distortion, and thus enabled a higher level of GDP. The marginal cost of public funds would have come down. Government (at all levels) is

> with this 10 per cent rate and the rate will not go up, and all of us will be the beneficiaries. The 10 per cent rate would have induced optimism on the part of the domestic and global private sector. India would have earned respect worldwide for having capabilities in policymaking. This would have fostered investment and thus GDP growth. In the first two years, significant resource reallocation would have started taking place, with firms discovering more efficient ways of working. This would have fed back into higher GDP growth and thus tax revenues. If these first two years had worked out well, that would be a triumph. If tax revenues were stubbornly low, the rate could have been raised from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. The right sequencing is to take on a harder problem (a higher tax rate) later in the game, as this requires greater state capacity. There is an interesting and self-stabilizing phenomenon associated with a large tax shortfall at the 10 per cent rate. Suppose it became clear that 10 per cent was not going to work, that the rate was likely to go up to (say) 12 per cent next year. Households would see this and increase their

> consumption, knowing that prices would go up in the future. This would give buoyant business-cycle conditions, and enlarged consumption, whichwould partly offset the difficulties. 1Summing upThe principles of this book suggest that the right way to design the GST is a single rate, a low rate, a comprehensive base, with an elegantly simple administrative system.

> 35Health policyPrevention versus cureThe founding intuition of the field of health policy is the tension between prevention and cure. Policymakers always face two rival pathways in health policy: of utilizing incremental expenditure or coercion for the purpose of preventing ill health versus utilizing incremental expenditure or coercion for the purpose of healthcare. In India, too little has been done by way of prevention, so the gains from incremental effort in prevention are substantial. Consider road safety. When a person suffers from a road accident that is not fatal, there are three consequences: (a) Pain and unhappiness; (b) If the affected person is a worker, there is the loss of output and possibly income on account of reduced days of work; and (c) Expenditures on healthcare. Given that India has some of the highest rates of road accidents in the world, on the margin, prevention seems better than cure. We are better off with fewer road accidents, rather than having casualties and then supplying the commensurate healthcare services. A little general equilibrium intuition is useful in thinking about a world where fewer people require healthcare. If road safety in India was improved, there would be fewer jobs in trauma centres. The resources which go into producing healthcare, for a preventable accident, are reallocated by society when accidents are prevented. Healthcare production requires labour and capital in order to produce ambulance services, trauma centres, medical supplies, etc. In a world with fewer accidents, these resources get reallocated into producing goods and services that people
> ^T7CQ7KYEaLHYLNIRLp295

> [!note] Page 296
> 
> actually like, such as movies and clothes. When accidents are prevented, not only does society reduce expenditure on healthcare, we become better off because those same resources are shifted to producing things that people actually want. A world with fewer road accidents is thus one where some individuals experience less pain and suffering, there is less lost output, and society gains happiness as some resources switch from producing healthcare services to producing things that people actually like. At Indian levels of road safety, this is better than producing healthcare services to address the problem of road accidents. There is something awkward in counting the production of healthcare services, associated with preventable problems, as part of GDP. When air quality in India gets worse, there is greater purchase of healthcare services, and GDP as conventionally counted goes up. This detracts from the notion of higher GDP as synonymous with higher consumption and choice in the hands of the people. In a good country, we would spend less on healthcare as fewer people would get sick. We suspect that GDP will become a better measure of consumption and welfare if the healthcare expenditures, associated with preventable events, are subtracted from GDP.The case for state intervention in healthThe standard recipe of public economics is to start from conditions with no state, and identify the market failures. What goes wrong when we have pure laissez faire, when the government does nothing about health? There is a neat split between two classes of market failure.Public health: Consider the eradication of smallpox in India in 1975. 1 Once smallpox waseliminated, everyone gained welfare: this joy is non-rival and non-excludable. Controlling communicable diseases, and controlling sources of ill health such as road safety or natural disasters—these are public goods. The second class of market failure in the field of health concerns externalities. Pollution of water or air, and the impact of one infected person upon another, involve negative externalities. Here also, there is market failure and thus a case for state intervention.

> ‘Public health’ is defined as the population-scale initiatives that address externalities and provide public goods. Public health mostly involves prevention and not cure: it obtains a healthier population through reduction in sickness. In contrast, most healthcare involves private goods and not public goods. There is a great deal of confusion around terminology in this field. There is a need for a sharp delineation between four phrases: ‘public good’, ‘market failure’, ‘public health’ and ‘healthcare’. The phrase ‘public health’ is often misunderstood to mean ‘healthcare’. Many think that ‘public health’ is the health of the public. Conversely, it is often incorrectly assumed that ‘healthcare’ is a ‘public good’. The phrase ‘public health expenditure’ is often applied for government expenditures on healthcare, and it is particularly confusing because it contains the phrase ‘public health’ which is the antonym of ‘healthcare’. The phrase ‘government healthcare expenditure’ is unambiguous and thus preferable. Many of the advanced economies of today have been engaged in public health for a very long time. As an example, the UK began work on clean water in 1858 and on clean air in1952. 2 In many aspects, the public policy initiatives that address externalities and public goods in health are in place, in advanced economies. 3 As a consequence, there is limitedinterest in public health in the contemporary policy debates of advanced economies. But in countries such as India, public health is not a solved problem. There is often an inappropriate transfer of concepts and priorities, from the health policy debates of advanced economies, into Indian thinking about health policy. This has given a certain loss of focus upon public health in India. In 2018, the World Health Organization began a ‘Common Goods in Health’ (CGH)initiative. 4 The attempt here is to bring back a focus upon the population-scale policy actions,i.e., addressing externalities and providing public goods, in health policy. The phrase ‘Common Goods in Health’ is unambiguous, and may help reduce the confusion associated with the phrases ‘public health’, ‘public goods’, ‘healthcare’ and ‘market failure’.Healthcare: India has drifted into a largely unregulated private healthcare market. Most healthcare services are purchased from private doctors and hospitals. The private healthcare market suffers from the other two kinds of market failure: asymmetric information and market power.People respond to incentives. Doctors are people. Doctors respond to incentives.The economic analysis of the behaviour of doctors and hospitals yields great insights. In some ideal world, doctors are altruistic. However, in the real world, the behaviour of doctors is shaped by their self-interest and the objective of revenue maximization. There is extreme asymmetric information between a doctor and a patient. When a doctor says that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required, the patient is likely to comply. When the MRI laboratory pays a kickback to the doctor, as is common in India, medical malpractice arises. Prices of healthcare tend to skyrocket when individuals are unable to engage in comparison shopping for healthcare services with predictability of expenditures.

> In a simple for-profit setting, the incentive of the doctor is not to heal the patient. The incentive of the doctor is to extract maximal revenue. Alongside this, it is efficient to make the patient feel subjectively better. This is done by over-prescribing antibiotics, by prescribing steroids (that briefly make a person feel better), by having a good bedside manner, by earning likes on social media, etc. Such strategies do not heal, but they generate more referrals. In a simple for-profit setting, there is no incentive for the doctor to guide the patient into pathways that prevent future requirements of healthcare. Public policy initiatives are required to address these market failures in healthcare.The Indian journeyUnder colonial rule, there was an emphasis on the public goods of sanitation and communicable disease. A government committee, led by Sir Joseph Bhore from 1943 to 1946, envisaged a shift in focus from public health to healthcare, and advocated a government-run healthcare system. This was an extremely influential report, and shaped a large reorientation ofhealth policy in the following decades. 5By the 1980s, it was clear that these modifications were working poorly. The disease burden was high, owing to weaknesses in public health. Thegovernment-dominated healthcare system was working poorly. 6 Individualswere increasingly resorting to private healthcare. Politicians became increasingly aware of the unhappiness of individuals. Ideally, these difficulties should have generated a fresh focus upon public health. However, building capabilities in public health is difficult. To have tens of thousands of health workers, all over India, who fight mosquitoes, is a difficult problem in public administration. Health policy in recent decades has instead taken the path of least resistance—to use public money to buy insurance (often from private health insurance companies) for individuals who would obtain healthcare servicesfrom private healthcare providers. 7 This is an inefficient path in three ways:Weak public health gives a high disease burden, there is market failure in the private healthcare industry, and there is market failure in the healthinsurance industry. 8

> The focus of health policy in India must be upon prevention, i.e., upon public health. This includes immunization, disease vectors such as mosquitoes, monitoring of disease outbreaks and fighting epidemics, drug safety, food safety, air quality, water quality, waste management, disaster risk resilience, disaster response, etc. These areas require prioritization and the development of state capacity.

> Ministry of Health. As an example, air quality is a key public health crisis that afflicts north India. However, the problem of air quality lies in the Ministry of Environment and not the Ministry of Health. Public health considerations need to shape the working of many ministries. As an example, the Indian road safety crisis is a first-order challenge for public health. The agencies building and operating roads should carry targets for accident rates and not just targets for kilometres of highways built.Policy pathways in healthcareAt present, we face a difficult situation in healthcare. The public sector is not effective at translating expenditures into healthcare services. Privately produced healthcare is afflicted with market failure. Health insurance

> companies suffer from poor financial regulation (of insurance) and from dealing with a malfunctioning healthcare system. Greater government spending on healthcare is popular. At present, there are two pathways for this increased expenditure. More money can be put into government healthcare facilities such as primary health centres (PHCs) or government hospitals. Alternatively, more money can be put into health insurance companies who intermediate between individuals and private healthcare providers. Both these pathways work poorly. As a consequence, the welfare gains from increased government expenditure on healthcare, under the present paradigm of healthcare, are likely to be low. The key insight lies in system thinking, in re-imagining the contractual relationships to achieve incentive compatibility. Imagine a contract between a network of healthcare providers and the patient which underwrites all healthcare for the patient for life, in exchange for fixed monthly payments. This must be not just one doctor, but a network of providers that covers all aspects of healthcare. When you get sick, you would go to your healthcare network, and they would render you healthcare services, at no additional cost. Such networks are called ‘Health Maintenance Organizations’ (HMOs). Once this style of contracting is done, the incentives of the healthcare producer change. Now, the HMO is paid by you every month, and these payments are clean profit for them, until you get sick. When you get sick, you impose costs upon them. They have no incentive to over-prescribe procedures, and their incentive is to keep you healthy. Now the HMO has the incentive to ask you to come in for regular checkups, so that problems are caught early. At all ages, immunization will be pushed by the HMO, so as to avoid the costs associated with illness. The choice of treatments will be done with a view to keeping you healthy. At present, the conversation between a doctor and a patient in India is a transactional one, where symptoms are described and treatments are explained. The time in that room is a powerful opportunity to change behaviour. A few minutes spent by the doctor evangelizing better behaviour tends to have a significant impact on behaviour and health. As an example,

> A doctor in an HMO who sees a surge of an infectious disease in her neighbourhood would have the incentive to talk with public health officials, and initiate public health responses which address the epidemic at the root cause. This is incentive-compatible as the HMO makes more money when fewer people get sick.

> state capacity. The UK government is able to make sure that GPs show up to work, and are conscientious about their work even though this is a transaction-intensive, discretion-intensive service. Under present Indian conditions of state capacity, this is infeasible, outside of islands of state capacity such as AIIMS. Addressing these difficulties of healthcare requires system thinking. It is hard to see how the self-organizing system of the market economy will find the HMO solution. The present structure of incentives encourages doctors to earn super normal incomes by over-prescribing procedures and thus earning revenues and kickbacks. This is analogous to the emergence of the New Pension System in the context of money management. Left to itself, the private sector finds it hard to break away from the toxic sales practices of insurance companies and mutual funds, and the supernormal fees charged by fund managers who do not add value.

> At the same time, system thinking is a highly difficult problem in public policy; at low levels of state capacity it is too easy for central planning to emerge with the wrong answers. A tremendous amount of work is now required, in policy thinking on healthcare in India, to find the right pathways for system design, while recognizing that system thinking is a difficult problem in public policy.The correlation between GDP and healthIn the international experience, when a country gets richer, the health of the population improves. This is a strong correlation. However, like all correlations, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between the two. In some respects, we can see how becoming richer enables better health in India. As an example, a richer family would have better nutrition, and be able to spend more on private healthcare. A richer family would generally have higher education, and better knowledge feeds into better health. However, there are also many elements in India, where increased prosperity has harmed the disease burden. As an example, we now have the new challenges of air quality and road safety, which are harming people today, which were not present a few decades ago. We should not assume that higher GDP growth will always give us improvements in the health of the population, in line with what has happened on average in the international experience. That average international experience is predicated on sophisticated health policy thinking, that has come about in each country as the country achieved a greater intellectual capacity in public policy. We in India will need to achieve an improved intellectual capacity, in public policy work on public health and on healthcare, in order to obtain the full translation of higher GDP into improved health.

> Summing upHealth policy is one of the hardest parts of public policy. The toolkit of market failure and state capacity gives us important insights into the field. There is a neat and vertical split between two classes of market failure (public goods and externalities) that shape the field of ‘public health’ or ‘common goods for health’ and the other two classes of market failure (asymmetric information and market power) that shape healthcare. We in India need to change course. Under the present trajectory, GDP growth is inducing greater ill health through problems such as pollution, natural disasters and road safety. In the government, public health capabilities have atrophied: we do worse on critical problems like vector control when compared with many decades ago. Voters are unhappy, and the government is trying to subsidize their purchase of private healthcare services from a private healthcare system that suffers from extensive market failure. Thinking about market failure and state capacity from first principles is required in public health and in healthcare. As in many other fields, there is a lot of interest in technological fixes for health policy. There is undoubtedly great opportunity in using better technology, ranging from mundane process automation using better data handling, all the way to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will replace doctors. However, the foundation of beneficial technology adoption lies in incentives. Our first priority has to be to address the foundations: to reorganize health policy around the problems of market failure and state capacity. Under each of the two wings—public health and healthcare—a research community is required and the full policy pipeline is required. We need to establish data sets, develop a research literature, incubate diverse policy proposals, debate them, develop a mature point of view on how the problems will be solved, present these choices to legislators, enact new laws, and then build the state capacity to enforce these laws. Health policy is a less mature field in India, in the development of the policy pipeline,
