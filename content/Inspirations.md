Hi  
  
Excellent question. The answer really depends on your context. Young researchers & new entrants to the field will have different requirements from people who have spent more time in any area.  
  
My general recommendation is:  
1. Read at least three newspapers a day: international, national & regional. You won’t need to read everything, but scan through the front page of the website to get an overall picture and zoom into articles that attract your interest. Avoid algorithmic feeds everywhere  
2. Subscribe to newsletters of your choice using a different email address (eg. I use mailto:nitin.pai.reader@gmail.com to receive all newsletters). Look at the Takshashila newsletters for instance. If you choose wisely, you’ll get distilled wisdom from people who’ve done the hard work of processing news & developments.   
3. Similar to #2 subscribe to RSS feeds of blogs. There still excellent blogs out there. In fact if you use a newsreader app, then you can even read substack newsletters on them.   
4. Assign one or two days a week to read magazine content: Economist, The Atlantic, Frontline, etc  
5. Use physical, ebooks & audiobooks to your advantage. Most of my leisure reading (fiction) is usually on audiobooks. I get around 1 hour extra per day by listening to audiobooks while walking the dog or commuting to work.   
6. Similar to #5: listen to podcasts.   
  
What not to do:  
1. Avoid television. The best place to keep your TV is outside the window. When throwing it out of the window, please make sure it does not hurt anyone below. Especially if you live in a high rise apartment.  
2. Avoid over-engagement on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp etc. These are bad for your mental health.  
3. Avoid news addiction. You don’t need to follow the “news” as much as you think.   
4. Avoid getting stuck in reading. If a book or paper is too boring, skip it and move to something else. Don’t feel guilty over unread books.
